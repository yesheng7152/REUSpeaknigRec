== Controversy ==
=== Leaking user data ===
In January 2014, it was revealed that ''Angry Birds'' was considered a "leaky app" and was used to collect data about its users including their sexual orientation and location by the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] and [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]]. In retaliation, anti-NSA hackers defaced Rovio's website. Claims were made by [[Edward Snowden]] that the app was ''leaky'' and that they were capable of [[siphoning]] off data.<ref name="crashingdown">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2548134/Angry-Birds-come-crashing-Maker-Rovios-site-hacked-NSA-spy-scandal-revealed-leaky-app-used-gather-data-users.html |title=Angry Birds come crashing down: Rovio's site hacked after NSA spy scandal revealed it was a 'leaky app' used to gather data on users |date=29 January 2014 |work= [[The Daily Mail]]|accessdate=2014-01-30}}</ref>

According to ''[[The Register]]'', the information was leaked through the in-game advertisement code like that embedded by [[Millennial Media]]: "Millennial's tracking software generates a personal record for each user that can store information from their political affiliation and sexual orientation to whether their marital state was single, married, divorced, engaged or 'swinger'. This information is used to target in-app ads more effectively, and can be collected by UK and US intelligence agencies for analysis".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/01/27/leaking_smartphone_apps_nsa_gchq/|title=Fancy a little kinky sex?

Following this revelation, on January 29, the Angry Birds site was defaced by hackers who replaced it with "Spying Birds" via a [[DNS hijacking]] attack. According to Rovio, "The defacement was caught in minutes and corrected immediately".<ref name="spybirds">{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2092560/hackers-deface-angry-birds-website-following-nsa-spying-claims.html|title=Hackers transform Angry Birds website into 'Spying Birds' following NSA claims|author=Lucian Constantin|date=29 January 2014|work=PCWorld}}</ref> The [[Syrian Electronic Army]] tweeted after the incident that the attack had been carried out by "a friend" of theirs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2430080,00.asp|title=Angry Birds Website Defaced After NSA Spying Allegations|work=PCMAG}}</ref>
