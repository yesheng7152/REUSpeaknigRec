'''''Help Me Anthea, I'm Infested''''' is a 2007 factual entertainment television show produced by RDF Television<ref name="rdf">[http://www.rdftelevision.com/categories.aspx?type=factual%20entertainment&programmeid=184&cid=2 Help Me Anthea, I'm Infested!], RDF Television website</ref> for [[BBC Three]], presented by [[Anthea Turner]] and Mark Coltman, a professional pest control expert. The presenters visit people whose houses have pest control problems, give them advice and help them to exterminate vermin.

Originally slated for six episodes,<ref name="rdf" /> the BBC cut the series short after the third episode was broadcast.<ref name="iplayer">[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0081295/episodes/guide Help Me Anthea, I'm Infested] Episode Guide, bbc.co.uk</ref> According to an interview with Anthea Turner, only the first three episodes were planned to be on bug infestations, although she did not specify what later episodes would cover.<ref>{{cite news|last=Moss|first=Caz|title=Exclusive Anthea Turner Interview|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/entertainment/Anthea+Turner-39749.html|accessdate=9 November 2011|newspaper=Female First|date=29 August 2007}}</ref> 

Critical reactions were very negative: James Watson at the'' [[Daily Telegraph]]'' described it as being both boring and exhibiting "grinding, excruciating pointlessness",<ref>{{cite news|last=Watson|first=James|title=Last night on television: Benidorm Unpacked (ITV1) - Help Me Anthea, I'm Infested!
