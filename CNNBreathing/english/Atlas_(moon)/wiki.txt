'''Atlas''' ({{pronEng|ˈætləs}} {{respell|AT|ləs}}, or as Greek ''Άτλας)'' is an [[inner satellite]] of [[Saturn]].

Atlas was discovered by [[Richard Terrile]] in 1980 (some time before November 12) from [[Voyager program|Voyager]] photos and was designated '''{{nowrap|S/1980 S 28}}'''.<ref>[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/03500/03539.html IAUC 3539: ''1980 S 28''] November 13, 1980 (discovery)</ref> In 1983 it was officially named after [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] of [[Greek mythology]], because it "holds the rings on its shoulders" like the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] Atlas held the sky up above the [[Earth]].<ref>[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/03800/03872.html IAUC 3872: ''Satellites of Jupiter and Saturn''] September 30, 1983 (naming the moon)</ref> It is also designated as '''{{nowrap|Saturn XV}}'''.

Atlas is the closest satellite to the sharp outer edge of the [[Rings_of_Saturn#A_Ring|A ring]], and was long thought to be a [[shepherd satellite]] for this ring. However, now it is known that the outer edge of the ring is instead maintained by a 7:6 [[orbital resonance]] with the larger but more distant moons [[Janus (moon)|Janus]] and [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]]. <ref name="Lakdawalla2007">{{cite web

</ref> In 2004 a faint, thin ring, temporarily designated {{nowrap|[[R/2004 S 1]]}}, was discovered within Atlas's orbit.<ref>[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/08400/08401.html IAUC 8401: ''S/2004 S 3, S/2004 S 4, and R/2004 S 1''] September 9, 2004</ref>

High-resolution images taken in June 2005 by ''[[Cassini-Huygens Mission|Cassini]]'' reveal a saucer-shaped moon with a large smooth [[equatorial ridge]]. The most likely explanation for this unusual and prominent  structure is that ring material swept up by the moon accumulates on the moon, with a strong preference for the equator due to the ring's thinness. In fact, the size of the equatorial ridge is comparable with the expected size of Atlas's [[Roche lobe]]. This would mean that for any further particles attempting to accumulate on the equator, the [[centrifugal force]] overcomes Atlas's tiny gravity and they will be lost. <ref name="Lakdawalla2007"/>

Atlas is significantly perturbed by [[Prometheus (moon)|Prometheus]] and to a lesser degree by [[Pandora (moon)|Pandora]], leading to excursions in longitude of up to 600&nbsp;km (~0.25°) away from the precessing keplerian orbit with a rough period of about 3 years. Since the orbits of Prometheus and Pandora are chaotic, it is suspected that Atlas's may be as well.<ref name="Spitale2006"/>
