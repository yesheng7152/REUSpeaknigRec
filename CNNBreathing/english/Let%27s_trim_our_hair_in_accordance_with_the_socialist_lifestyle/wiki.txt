It was broadcast on state-run [[Korean Central Television]] in the capital of [[Pyongyang]] and clips from the program were later rebroadcast on the British channel [[BBC One]]. The program claimed that [[hair]] length can affect [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]], in part because of the deprivation to the rest of the body of [[nutrient]]s required for hair to grow.<ref name="getasocialist" /> However, although some researchers have proposed that brain and hair are in competition from an evolutionary standpoint,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4190188/pdf/40064_2014_Article_1264.pdf|title=Hair for brain trade-off, a metabolic bypass for encephalization|author=Dror and Hopp|publisher=Springer Verlag|date=2014-09-27|accessdate=2016-02-09}}</ref> cutting hair has no influence on its rate of growth.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/07/hair-growth-tips-trim_n_1477383.html|title=Hair Growth Tips: Do Regular Trims Really Make It Grow Faster?|date=2012-05-07|work=[[Huffington Post]]|accessdate=2016-02-09}}</ref>  It was part of a longstanding North Korean government restriction campaign against haircuts and fashions deemed at odds with "[[Socialism|Socialist]] values".<ref name="nkoreawages"/>

==North Korea's fashion restrictions==
Such dress and hair standards have long been a fixture of North Korean society. [[Kim Jong-il|Kim Jong-Il]] was known for his so-called "''Speed Battle Cut''" [[crew cut]] when he first came to prominence in the early 1980s, though he later reverted to the short sided [[bouffant]] favored by [[Kim Il-sung|his father]].<ref>Paul French. North Korea: The Paranoid Peninsula: A Modern History. Zed Books (2007) ISBN 1-84277-905-2 p. 15</ref> After Kim Jong-Il succeeded his father, some of the state's restrictions on Western fashion were relaxed.  Women were allowed permanent waves, men could grow slightly longer hair, and even public dancing was allowed.<ref>Bradley K. Martin. Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader. Macmillan (2006) ISBN 0-312-32322-0,  p. 378</ref> Despite such slight concessions during the early years of Kim Jong-Il's rule, obvious emblems of Western fashion such as [[jeans]] continued to be entirely banned, and long hair on men could lead to arrest and forced haircuts.<ref>French (2007) pp. 15–16</ref>

According to the North Korean daily ''[[Rodong Sinmun]]'' (Worker's Newspaper), the leadership was fighting a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the possible incursion of [[capitalism]] into the sphere of personal appearance. Along with long hair, untidy shoes were identified as the epitome of Western culture which, by imitation, would lead the country to ruin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=705|title=Keeping Our Hair On|author=Tirthankar Mukherjee|publisher=[[UB Post]]|date=2007-10-04|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref>

==Television series==
The series began in 2004 as part of the regular television program ''[[Common Sense (TV series)|Common Sense]]''. In the autumn of that year, a larger [[Media of North Korea|media]] campaign (print and radio as well as television)<ref name=getasocialist/> began promoting proper attire and neat appearances for men. The show encouraged short hairstyles, such as the flat-top crew cut, middle hairstyle, low hairstyle, and high hairstyle. It said that hair should be kept between {{convert|1|and|5|cm|1|abbr=on}} in length, and recommended haircuts for men every 15 days. The country's official hairstyles did allow men over 50 years old to grow their upper hair up to {{convert|7|cm|abbr=on}} long, to [[Comb over|disguise balding]].<ref name="nkoreawages"/>

An initial five-part series of the show featured officially endorsed haircut styles, while a later series went a step further by showing certain men as examples of how ''not'' to trim one's hair. With each example, the show conveyed the person's name and where they lived (or worked) via subtitles and/or voice.<ref name="getasocialist"/> For example, in one episode (shown in January 2005) a North Korean citizen named Mr. Ko Gwang Hyun, whose unkempt hair covered his ears, was shown as a negative role model, with the [[voiceover]] commentary: "We cannot help questioning the cultural taste of this comrade, who is incapable of feeling ashamed of his hair style. Can we expect a man with this disheveled mind-set to perform his duty well?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?click_id=3&art_id=qw1107252004338B252|title=It's all about hair as communists wage war|author=Sang-Hun Choe|publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)]]|date=2005-02-01|accessdate=2009-03-14}}</ref>

In the North Korean capital city of [[Pyongyang]], Western news articles reported that a [[hidden camera]] was placed to catch citizens with improper hairstyles. This was part of a television programme broadcast at the same time as ''Let's Trim Our Hair in Accordance with the Socialist Lifestyle''. The offenders would then be interviewed by the presenter and asked to explain themselves. Their name, address and workplace would be announced to deter others from being embarrassed and ostracized.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4157121.stm|title=N.
