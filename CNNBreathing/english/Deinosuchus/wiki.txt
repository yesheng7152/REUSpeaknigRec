'''''Deinosuchus''''' ({{pron-en|ˌdaɪnəˈsuːkəs}} {{respell|DYE|no|S'''OO'''|kəs}}) is an [[extinct]] relative of the [[alligator]] that lived 80 to 73&nbsp;[[annum|Ma]] (million years ago), during the [[Late Cretaceous]] [[Geologic time scale#Terminology|period]]. The name translates as "terrible crocodile" and is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''δεινός''/''deinos'' ("terrible") and ''σουχος''/''soukhos'' ("crocodile"). The first remains were discovered in [[North Carolina]] in the 1850s, but it was not until 1909 that the [[genus]] was named and described. Additional fragments were discovered in the 1940s and were later incorporated into an influential, though inaccurate, skull reconstruction at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. Knowledge of ''Deinosuchus'' remains incomplete, but better [[Skull|cranial]] material found in recent years has expanded scientific understanding of this massive predator.

Although ''Deinosuchus'' was far larger than any modern crocodile or alligator—measuring up to {{Convert|12|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on|abbr=on}} and weighing up to {{convert|8.5|MT|ST}}—its overall appearance was fairly similar to its smaller relatives. It had large, robust teeth that were built for crushing, and its back was covered with thick semispherical [[osteoderm]]s. One study indicates that ''Deinosuchus'' may have lived for up to 50&nbsp;years, growing at a similar rate to that of modern crocodilians, but maintaining this growth over a much longer period of time.

''Deinosuchus'' fossils have been found in ten [[U.S. state]]s, as well as northern Mexico. It lived on both sides of the [[Western Interior Seaway]], and was an opportunistic [[apex predator]] in the coastal regions of eastern North America. ''Deinosuchus'' reached its largest size in its western habitat, but the eastern populations were far more abundant. Opinion remains divided as to whether these two populations represent separate [[species]]. ''Deinosuchus'' was probably capable of killing and eating large [[dinosaur]]s. It may have also fed upon [[sea turtle]]s, fish, and other aquatic and terrestrial prey.

}}</ref> David R. Schwimmer noted in 2002 that the smaller and more common form of ''Deinosuchus'' found in eastern North America usually had skulls about {{Convert|1|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long. Using an equation based on skull size, Schwimmer estimated that they probably had a total body length of about {{Convert|8|m|ft|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}, and weighed about {{convert|2.3|MT|ST}}. According to Schwimmer's research, ''Deinosuchus'' reached larger sizes in the western portion of the continent. A reasonably well-preserved skull specimen discovered in [[Texas]] indicated that the animal's head measured about {{Convert|1.31|m|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}, and from this Schwimmer calculated a body length of {{Convert|9.8|m|ft|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. Although the largest remains of ''Deinosuchus'' had skulls too poorly preserved to use this method of estimation, scaling from vertebrae indicates that some of them grew to even larger sizes. Schwimmer estimates that the biggest specimens had a total body length of up to {{Convert|12|m|ft|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}, and perhaps weighed {{convert|8.5|MT|ST}} or more.<ref name="schwimmer-size"/>

Although there is some disagreement as to its exact size, the fossil remains are nonetheless sufficient to indicate that ''Deinosuchus'' was substantially larger than any modern crocodilian. Even the relatively low estimate provided by Erickson and Brochu suggests that the maximum weight reached by ''Deinosuchus'' exceeded that of currently living species by a factor of three to five.<ref name="erickson-brochu"/> ''Deinosuchus'' has often been described as the largest crocodilian of all time, but some other crocodyliforms—including ''[[Purussaurus]]'', ''[[Rhamphosuchus]]'', and ''[[Sarcosuchus]]''—may have equaled or exceeded it in size.<ref name="brochu-memoirs">{{cite journal

In 1954, Edwin H. Colbert and Roland T.

Schwimmer concluded in 2002 that the feeding patterns of ''Deinosuchus'' most likely varied by geographic location; the smaller ''Deinosuchus'' of eastern North America would have been opportunistic feeders in an ecological niche similar to that of the modern [[American Alligator|American alligator]]. They would have consumed marine turtles, large fish, and smaller dinosaurs.<ref name="schwimmer-size"/> The bigger, but less common, ''Deinosuchus'' that lived in Texas and Montana might have been more specialized hunters, capturing and eating large dinosaurs.<ref name="schwimmer-size"/> Schwimmer noted that no theropod dinosaurs in ''Deinosuchus'''s eastern range approached its size, indicating that the massive crocodilian could have been the region's [[apex predator]].<ref name="schwimmer-prey"/>

===Growth rates===
A 1999 study by Gregory M. Erickson and Christopher A. Brochu suggested that the growth rate of ''Deinosuchus'' was comparable to that of modern crocodilians, but was maintained over a far longer period of time.<ref name="erickson-brochu"/> Their estimates, based on growth rings in the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] osteoderms of various specimens, indicate that each ''Deinosuchus'' might have taken over 35&nbsp;years to reach full adult size, and that the oldest individuals may have lived for more than 50&nbsp;years.<ref name="erickson-brochu"/> This was a completely different growth strategy than that of large dinosaurs, which reached adult size much more quickly and had shorter lifespans.<ref name="erickson-brochu"/> According to Erickson, a full-grown ''Deinosuchus'' "must have seen several generations of dinosaurs come and go".<ref name="connor">{{cite news

}}</ref>

Schwimmer noted in 2002 that Erickson and Brochu's assumptions about growth rates are only valid if the osteodermal rings reflect annual periods, as they do in modern crocodilians.<ref name="schwimmer-size"/> According to Schwimmer, the growth ring patterns observed in ''Deinosuchus'' could have been affected by a variety of factors, including "migrations of their prey, wet-dry seasonal climate variations, or oceanic circulation and nutrient cycles".<ref name="schwimmer-size"/> If the ring cycle was biannual rather than annual, this might indicate that ''Deinosuchus'' grew faster than modern crocodilians, and had a similar maximum lifespan.<ref name="schwimmer-size"/>

== Discovery and naming ==
[[Image:Polyptychodon tooth by Emmons.png|thumb|left|Ebenezer Emmons illustrated two fossil teeth in 1858. Most likely, they belonged to the crocodilian that would later be named ''Deinosuchus''.]]

}}</ref> Emmons assigned these teeth to ''[[Polyptychodon]]'', which he then believed to be "a [[genus]] of crocodilian reptiles".<ref name="emmons"/> Later discoveries showed that ''Polyptychodon'' was actually a [[pliosaur]], a type of marine reptile.<ref name="schwimmer-early"/> The teeth described by Emmons were thick, slightly curved, and covered with vertically grooved enamel; he assigned them a new [[species]] name, ''P. rugosus''.<ref name="emmons"/> Although not initially recognized as such, these teeth were probably the first ''Deinosuchus'' remains to be scientifically described.<ref name="schwimmer-early"/> Another large tooth that likely came from ''Deinosuchus'', discovered in neighboring [[Sampson County, North Carolina|Sampson County]], was named ''Polydectes biturgidus'' by [[Edward Drinker Cope]] in 1869.<ref name="schwimmer-early"/>

In 1903, at [[Willow Creek, Montana]], several fossil osteoderms were discovered "lying upon the surface of the soil" by [[John Bell Hatcher]] and T.W. Stanton.<ref name="holland"/> These osteoderms were initially attributed to the [[Ankylosauridae|ankylosaurid]] dinosaur ''[[Euoplocephalus]]''.<ref name="holland"/> Excavation at the site, carried out by W.H. Utterback, yielded further fossils, including additional osteoderms as well as vertebrae, [[rib]]s, and a [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]].<ref name="holland"/> When these specimens were examined, it became clear that they belonged to a large crocodilian and not a dinosaur; upon learning this, Hatcher "immediately lost interest" in the material.<ref name="holland"/> After Hatcher died in 1904, his colleague [[William Jacob Holland|W.J. Holland]] studied and described the fossils.<ref name="holland"/> Holland assigned these specimens to a new genus and species, ''Deinosuchus hatcheri'', in 1909.<ref name="holland"/> ''Deinosuchus'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''δεινός/deinos'', meaning "terrible", and ''σουχος/suchos'', meaning "crocodile".<ref name="holland"/>

The American Museum of Natural History incorporated the skull and jaw fragments into a plaster restoration, modeled after the present-day [[Cuban Crocodile|Cuban crocodile]].<ref name="colbert-bird"/> Colbert and Bird stated that this was a "conservative" reconstruction, since an even greater length could have been obtained if a long-skulled modern species such as the [[Saltwater Crocodile|saltwater crocodile]] had been used as the template.<ref name="colbert-bird"/> Because it was not then known that ''Deinosuchus'' had a broad snout, Colbert and Bird miscalculated the proportions of the skull, and the reconstruction greatly exaggerated its overall width and length.<ref name="schwimmer-early"/> Despite its inaccuracies, the reconstructed skull became the best-known specimen of ''Deinosuchus'', and brought public attention to this giant crocodilian for the first time.<ref name="schwimmer-early"/>

Numerous additional specimens of ''Deinosuchus'' were discovered over the next several decades. Most were quite fragmentary, but they expanded knowledge of the giant predator's geographic range. As noted by Christopher A. Brochu, the osteoderms are distinctive enough that even "bone granola" can adequately confirm the presence of ''Deinosuchus''.<ref name="schwimmer-early"/><ref name="brochu-occurrences">{{cite mailing list

[[Image:Deinosuchus at the CMNH.jpg|thumb|''Deinosuchus'' scutes and vertebra, [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]]]]
''Deinosuchus'' was classified in the family [[crocodile|Crocodylidae]] by Colbert and Bird, primarily on the basis of dental features resembling those of modern crocodiles.<ref name="colbert-bird"/> However, a [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] re-evaluation conducted in 1999 by Brochu determined that ''Deinosuchus'' was actually a primitive member of [[Alligatoroidea]]. Thus, ''Deinosuchus'' "is not the world's largest crocodile—it is one of the largest alligators."<ref name="brochu-memoirs"/> This classification was bolstered in 2005 by the discovery of a well-preserved ''Deinosuchus'' [[Skull|braincase]] from the Blufftown Formation of Alabama, which shows some features reminiscent of those in the modern American alligator.<ref name="knight">{{cite journal

Schwimmer (2002) considered all ''Deinosuchus'' specimens to belong to one species.<ref name="schwimmer-species"/> He noted that there were more similarities than differences between the eastern and western populations, and that most of these differences related only to the larger size of the western specimens.<ref name="schwimmer-species"/> Under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'s rules of priority, this species would be named ''D. rugosus''.<ref name="schwimmer-species"/> Lucas ''et al.'' (2006) also considered ''Deinosuchus'' a [[monospecificity|monospecific]] genus.<ref name="lucas"/> However, Brochu (2003) questioned Schwimmer's analysis, suggesting that size might be a significant diagnostic feature and that several of the features used by Schwimmer to establish [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]] between the two populations are actually [[cladistics#plesiomorphy|primitive]] traits shared by other genera as well.<ref name="brochu-review"/> Schwimmer (2002) informally referred to the western populations as ''D. riograndensis'', and several other researchers, including Anglen and Lehman (2000) and Westgate ''et al.'' (2006) have also recently assigned western ''Deinosuchus'' remains to this species.<ref name="schwimmer-species"/><ref name="westgate-et-al"/><ref name="anglen-lehman"/>
