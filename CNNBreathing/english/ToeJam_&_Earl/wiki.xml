'''''ToeJam &amp; Earl''''' is an [[action game]] developed by [[Johnson Voorsanger Productions]] and published by [[Sega]] for the [[Mega Drive]]. Released in 1991, it centers on the titular ToeJam and Earl—extraterrestrials who have crash-landed on Earth—as they attempt to escape the planet. Players assume the role of either character and collect pieces of their wrecked spacecraft. ''ToeJam &amp; Earl'''s design was heavily influenced by the [[computer role-playing game]] ''[[Rogue (computer game)|Rogue]]'', and took from it such features as the random generation of levels and items. It references and parodies 1990s urban culture and is set to a [[Funk (music)|funk]] soundtrack.

The game was positively received by critics, who praised its originality, soundtrack, humor and two-player cooperative mode. It attained [[sleeper hit]] status despite low initial sales, and its protagonists were used as mascots by Sega. ''ToeJam &amp; Earl'' was followed by two sequels: ''[[ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron]]'' and ''[[ToeJam &amp; Earl III: Mission to Earth]]'', released for the Mega Drive and [[Xbox]], respectively. The sequels' commercial and critical success was mixed; research has suggested that series fans favor the original ''ToeJam &amp; Earl''. The game again received positive reviews in 2006 when re-released for the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]], but certain critics believed that it had become dated.

In the game's opening sequence, ToeJam explains that Earl's erratic piloting abilities have resulted in a crash-landing on Earth.

''ToeJam &amp; Earl'' takes place from a top-down perspective in a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] game world. Its gameplay mechanics were inspired by ''[[Rogue (computer game)|Rogue]]'', which has led to its description as a [[Roguelike]] or [[dungeon-crawl]] game.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;gamespot&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;gamedesign&quot;</attr></ext> The game contains both single-player and two-player cooperative modes.

The game is set on Earth, which is represented by randomly-generated islands that float in space,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=gamespot </attr></ext> each one a layer above the last. They are connected by elevators. Some islands contain pieces of spacecraft wreckage, of which the player must collect 10 to win the game.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;funkotronics&quot;</attr></ext> The [[player character]] drops to the island below if he falls from an island's edge, which necessitates that the player again locate an elevator.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;mm&quot;</attr><inner>Julian Rignall &amp; Edward &quot;Rad&quot; Laurence, &quot;Mega Drive Review: ToeJam &amp; Earl&quot;, ''[[Mean Machines]]'', Nov 1991 (issue 14), pp. 106–08</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Each island is populated by antagonistic &quot;Earthlings&quot;, such as phantom ice-cream trucks, aggressive packs of &quot;[[nerds]]&quot;, giant hamsters, [[Bogeymen]], man-eating mailboxes, and police chickens.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;funkotronics&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmtv/features/alienguide/tjande.asp UGO's Guide to the Galaxy], [[UGO]], Accessed Apr 8, 2009</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;mm&quot;</attr></ext> Certain Earthlings aid the player.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;funkotronics&quot;</attr></ext> The game has been described as &quot;largely non-violent&quot;,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;1up&quot;</attr></ext> as the protagonists can only attack enemies with thrown tomatoes—one of many temporary, randomly-generated [[power-up]]s.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;funkotronics&quot;</attr></ext>

<h level="2" i="3">==Development==</h>
''ToeJam &amp; Earl'' creator Greg Johnson became a fan of ''Rogue'' as a university student. After he left university, he worked on games for [[Electronic Arts]], including ''[[Starflight]]'' (1986).<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;gamasutrainterview&quot;</attr></ext> After the completion of ''[[Starflight 2]]'', Johnson conceived ''ToeJam &amp; Earl''—first the characters, then the plot—while on a beach in Hawaii.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;jamminout&quot;</attr><inner>&quot;Jammin' Out With Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger&quot;, ''[[Sega Visions]]'', May/June 1992, pp. 38–39</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The idea was a combination of ''Rogue'''s gameplay concepts and a lighter version of ''Starflight's'' science-fiction themes.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;funkotronics&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;gamasutrainterview&quot;</attr></ext> Johnson met programmer Mark Voorsanger through a mutual friend, while walking on [[Mount Tam]] in 1989. He related the concept of ''ToeJam &amp; Earl'' to Voorsanger, and the two resolved to make the game together. They formed Johnson Voorsanger Productions, and serious work on the game began soon after.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;gamasutrainterview&quot;</attr><inner>Alistair Wallis, [http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=11707 Playing Catch Up: ToeJam &amp; Earl's Greg Johnson], [[Gamasutra]], Nov 16, 2006, Accessed Apr 6, 2009</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Their status as commercial game designers allowed them to meet with Sega of America, and they used cards covered in landscape drawings to demonstrate their idea of randomly generated levels.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;gamasutrainterview&quot;</attr></ext> Sega marketing manager Hugh Bowen was immediately interested in the concept; Sega wanted innovative games and new mascots to compete with [[Nintendo]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;gamasutrainterview&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;funkotronics&quot;</attr><inner>Travis Fahs, [http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/945/945419p1.html Funkotronics 101], [[IGN]], Jan 15, 2009, Accessed Apr 6, 2009</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> 

The game's small development team was composed of Johnson's previous colleagues,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;funkotronics&quot;</attr></ext> and its music was composed by John Baker. The team's goal was to make a humorous game that was &quot;original, easy to understand and offered an immediate response to the player's actions&quot;. The designers wanted to include a two-player mode so that they could play together, and considered ''ToeJam &amp; Earl'' &quot;a two player game with a one player option.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;jamminout&quot;</attr></ext> While Sega believed that hardware issues would prevent the feature from working, Voorsanger successfully implemented it.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;gamasutrainterview&quot;</attr></ext> In a 1992 interview with ''[[Sega Visions]]'', Johnson stated that the characters ToeJam and Earl evolved as reflections of his and Voorsanger's personalities.

The game built a cult following through [[word of mouth]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;gamasutrainterview&quot;</attr></ext> and it was further aided by the Mega Drive's Christmas 1991 sales spike, caused by the release of ''Sonic the Hedgehog''.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;funkotronics&quot;</attr></ext> ''ToeJam &amp; Earl'' was later considered a &quot;cult&quot; success.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;gamasutrainterview&quot;</attr></ext>
