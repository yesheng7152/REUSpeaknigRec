'''Jesus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|iː|z|ə|s}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἰησοῦς|Iesous}}; 7–2 BC to 30–33 AD), also referred to as '''Jesus of Nazareth''', is the central figure of [[Christianity]], whom the teachings of most [[Christian denominations]]<!-- NOTE: "most" makes a required distinction in that Christianity is diverse, and not all are Trinitarian or Nicene-based --> hold to be the [[Son of God]]. Christianity holds Jesus to be the awaited [[Messiah]] of the [[Old Testament]] and refers to him as '''Jesus Christ''', a name that is also used in non-Christian contexts.

A typical [[Jews|Jew]] in Jesus' time had only one name, sometimes supplemented with the father's name or the individual's hometown.<ref name=Britannica /> Thus, in the [[New Testament]], Jesus is referred to as "Jesus of Nazareth"{{efn|This article uses quotes from the [[New Revised Standard Version]] of the Bible.}} ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:71|Matthew 26:71]]), "Joseph's son" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#4:22|Luke 4:22]]), and "Jesus son of Joseph from Nazareth" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#1:45|John 1:45]]). However, in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#6:3|Mark 6:3]], rather than being called the son of Joseph, he is referred to as "the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon". The name ''Jesus'', as found in several modern languages, is derived from the Latin ''Iesus'', a [[transliteration]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Ἰησοῦς}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|Iesous}}'').<ref name="CE name">{{CathEncy | wstitle=Origin of the Name of Jesus Christ | first= Anthony J. |last= Maas}}</ref> The Greek form is a rendition of the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] {{rtl-lang|arc|ישוע}} (''Yeshua''), which is derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{rtl-lang|arc|יהושע}} (''Yehoshua'').<ref name="EhrmanDid29"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Joshua|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/joshua|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=August 4, 2013}}</ref> The name ''Yeshua'' appears to have been in use in Judea at the time of the birth of Jesus.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |isbn=978-0-664-23433-1 |title=Matthew |first=Douglas |last=Hare |year=2009 |page=11}}</ref> The first-century works of historian [[Flavius Josephus]] refer to at least twenty different people with this name.{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|p=129}} The etymology of Jesus' name in the context of the New Testament is generally given as "Yahweh is salvation".{{sfn|France|2007|p=53}}

The gospels offer several clues concerning the year of Jesus' birth. [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#2:1|Matthew 2:1]] associates the birth of Jesus with the reign of [[Herod the Great]], who died around 4 BC, and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#1:5|Luke 1:5]] mentions that Herod was on the throne shortly before the birth of Jesus,{{sfn|Maier|1989|pp=115–118}}{{sfn|Niswonger|1992|pp=121–122}} although this gospel also associates the birth with the [[Census of Quirinius]] which took place ten years later.{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=137–138}}{{sfn|Niswonger|1992|pp=122–124}} [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:23]] states that Jesus was "about thirty years old" at the start of his [[ministry of Jesus|ministry]], which according to [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#10:37|Acts 10:37–38]] was preceded by John's ministry, itself recorded in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1–2]] to have begun in the 15th year of [[Tiberius]]' reign (28 or 29 AD).{{sfn|Niswonger|1992|pp=121–122}}<ref name="Vermes2006">{{cite book | first = Géza | last = Vermes | title = The Nativity: History and Legend | publisher = Random House Digital | year = 2010|pages=81–82 |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=a9EiEU_Yz_kC&pg=PA81#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-307-49918-9}}</ref> By collating the gospel accounts with historical data and using various other methods, most scholars arrive at a date of birth between 6 and 4 BC for Jesus,<ref name="Vermes2006"/>{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=324}} but some propose estimates that lie in a wider range.{{efn|For example, John P.

Most scholars agree that the authors of Matthew and Luke [[Markan priority|used Mark as a source]] when writing their gospels. Matthew and Luke also share some content not found in Mark. To explain this, many scholars believe that in addition to Mark, another source (commonly called the "[[Q source]]") was used by the two authors.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rv8xNoRBtxMC&pg=PA210#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=The Resurrection of Jesus: A New Historiographical Approach | publisher=InterVarsity Press | year=2010 | pages=210–212 | isbn=978-0-8308-2719-0 |first=Michael R.|last= Licona }}</ref>

Accounts of the [[Genealogy of Jesus|genealogy]] and Nativity of Jesus appear in the New Testament only in the gospels of Luke and Matthew.

Matthew [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#1:1|begins his gospel]] with the genealogy of Jesus, before giving an account of Jesus' birth. He traces Jesus' ancestry to Abraham through David.

The gospels present John the Baptist's ministry as the precursor of that of Jesus. Starting with his baptism, Jesus begins his ministry in the countryside of Judea, near the River Jordan, when he is "about thirty years old" ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:23]]). He then travels, preaches and performs miracles, eventually completing his ministry with the Last Supper with his disciples in Jerusalem.{{sfn|McGrath|2006|pp=16–22}}

Near the beginning of his ministry, Jesus [[Commissioning of the Twelve Apostles|appoints twelve apostles]]. In Matthew and Mark, despite Jesus only briefly requesting that they join him, Jesus' first four apostles, who were fishermen, are described as immediately consenting, and abandoning their nets and boats to do so ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#4:18|Matthew 4:18–22]], [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#1:16|Mark 1:16–20]]). In John, Jesus' first two apostles were disciples of John the Baptist. The Baptist sees Jesus and calls him the [[Lamb of God]]; the two hear this and follow Jesus.{{sfn|Brown|1988|pp= 25–27}}{{sfn|Boring|Craddock|2004|pages= 292–293}} In addition to the Twelve Apostles, the opening of the passage of the [[Sermon on the Plain]] identifies a much larger group of people as disciples ([[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#6:17|Luke 6:17]]). Also, in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#10:1|Luke 10:1–16]] Jesus sends [[Seventy disciples|seventy or seventy-two of his followers]] in pairs to prepare towns for his prospective visit. They are instructed to accept hospitality, heal the sick and spread the word that the Kingdom of God is coming.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=The Gospel According to Luke | encyclopedia=New Collegeville Bible Commentary: New Testament | publisher=Liturgical Press | year=2009 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sdooTRyPMCwC&pg=PA255#v=onepage&q&f=false | page=255 | first=Michael F. | last=Patella | editor-first=Daniel | editor-last=Durken | isbn=978-0-8146-3260-4}}</ref>

Scholars divide the ministry of Jesus into several stages. The Galilean ministry begins when Jesus returns to Galilee from the Judaean Desert after rebuffing the temptation of [[Satan]]. Jesus preaches around Galilee, and in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#4:18|Matthew 4:18–20]], [[first disciples of Jesus|his first disciples]], who will eventually form the core of the early Church, encounter him and begin to travel with him.{{sfn|McGrath|2006|pp=16–22}}{{sfn|Redford|2007|pp=117–130}} This period includes the Sermon on the Mount, one of Jesus' major discourses,{{sfn|Redford|2007|pp=117–130}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Sermon on the mount: a theological investigation|first=Carl G.|last= Vaught|year=2001 |publisher=Baylor University Press |isbn =978-0-918954-76-3 |pages= xi–xiv}}</ref> as well as the [[calming the storm|calming of the storm]], the [[feeding the multitude|feeding of the 5,000]], [[Jesus' walk on water|walking on water]] and a number of other miracles and [[parables of Jesus|parables]].{{sfn|Redford|2007|pp=143–160}} It ends with the [[Confession of Peter]] and the Transfiguration.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Transfiguration, The | encyclopedia=The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Thought: Son of Man-Tremellius V11 |isbn= 978-1-4286-3189-2 | publisher=Funk & Wagnalls Company | year=1909 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=js5-eDk13TcC&pg=PA493#v=onepage&q&f=false | page=493 | last=Nash | first=Henry S. | editor-first=Samuel M. | editor-last=Jackson}}</ref><ref name= "Barton132">{{cite book|title=The Cambridge companion to the Gospels|first=Stephen C.|last= Barton |isbn= 978-0-521-80766-1 |pages= 132–133 |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref>

Commentaries often discuss the teachings of Jesus in terms of his "words and works".<ref name=WPent212 />{{sfn|Walvoord|Zuck|1983|p=346}} The words include a number of sermons, as well as parables that appear throughout the narrative of the Synoptic Gospels (the Gospel of John includes no narrative parables).

John's Gospel presents the teachings of Jesus not merely as his own preaching, but as divine revelation. John the Baptist, for example, states in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#3:34|John 3:34]]: "He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure." In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#7:16|John 7:16]] Jesus says, "My teaching is not mine but his who sent me." He asserts the same thing in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#14:10|John 14:10]]: "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?

In the four canonical gospels, Jesus' final entry into Jerusalem takes place at the beginning of the last week of his life, a few days before the Last Supper, marking the beginning of the Passion narrative.{{sfn|Boring|Craddock|2004|pp=256–258}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=114–118}} The day of entry into Jerusalem is identified by Mark and John as Sunday and by Matthew as Monday; Luke does not identify the day.{{sfn|Boring|Craddock|2004|pages=256–258}}{{sfn|Majerník|Ponessa|Manhardt|2005|pp=133–134}}{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=381–395}} After leaving [[Bethany (Biblical village)|Bethany]] Jesus rides a young donkey into Jerusalem.

In the three Synoptic Gospels, entry into Jerusalem is followed by the Cleansing of the Temple, in which Jesus expels the money changers from the temple, accusing them of turning it into a den of thieves through their commercial activities.

In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#26:62|Matthew 26:62]] Jesus' unresponsiveness leads Caiaphas to ask him, "Have you no answer?"{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=487–500}}{{sfn|Blomberg|2009|pp=396–400}}<ref name=Holman608 /> In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#14:61|Mark 14:61]] the high priest then asks Jesus, "Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?".

Taking Jesus to [[Pilate's Court]], the Jewish elders ask Roman governor Pontius Pilate to judge and condemn Jesus, accusing him of claiming to be the King of the Jews.<ref name=Holman608 /> The use of the word "king" is central to the discussion between Jesus and Pilate.

Observing a Passover custom of the time, Pilate allows one prisoner chosen by the crowd to be released. He gives the people a choice between Jesus and a murderer called [[Barabbas]].

Jesus' crucifixion is described in all four canonical gospels. After the trials, Jesus is led to Calvary [[Christ Carrying the Cross|carrying his cross]]; the route traditionally thought to have been taken is known as the [[Via Dolorosa]]. The three Synoptic Gospels indicate that [[Simon of Cyrene]] assists him, having been compelled by the Romans to do so.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509–520}}{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=211–214}} In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#23:27|Luke 23:27–28]] Jesus tells the women in the multitude of people following him not to weep for him but for themselves and their children.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509–520}} At Calvary, Jesus is offered a concoction usually offered as a painkiller. According to Matthew and Mark, he refuses it.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509–520}}{{sfn|Köstenberger|Kellum|Quarles|2009|pp=211–214}}

The soldiers then crucify Jesus and cast lots for his clothes. Above Jesus' head on the cross is Pilate's inscription, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews"; soldiers and passers-by mock him about it. Jesus is crucified between two convicted thieves, one of whom rebukes Jesus, while the other defends him.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509–520}}{{sfn|Doninger|1999|p=271}} The Roman soldiers break the two thieves' legs (a procedure designed to hasten death in a crucifixion), but they do not break those of Jesus, as he is already dead. In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John 19:34|John 19:34]], one soldier pierces Jesus' side with a lance, and water flows out.{{sfn|Doninger|1999|p=271}} In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#27:51|Matthew 27:51–54]], when Jesus dies, the heavy curtain at the Temple is torn and an earthquake breaks open tombs.

On the same day, [[Joseph of Arimathea]], with Pilate's permission and with [[Nicodemus]]' help, [[Descent from the Cross|removes Jesus' body from the cross]], wraps him in a clean cloth and buries him in a new [[Sepulchre|rock-hewn tomb]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509–520}} In [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#27:62|Matthew 27:62–66]], on the following day the Jews ask Pilate for the tomb to be sealed with a stone and placed under guard to ensure the body will remain there.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=509–520}}{{sfn|Morris|1992|page=727}}

[[File:Jesus ascending to heaven.jpg|left|thumb|Jesus' ascension to heaven, as depicted by [[John Singleton Copley]], 1775|alt=Clouds part as Jesus ascends to heaven. People below point in wonder.]]
New Testament accounts of Jesus' resurrection state that on the first day of the week after the crucifixion (typically interpreted as a Sunday), his tomb is discovered to be empty and his followers encounter him risen from the dead. His followers arrive at the tomb early in the morning and meet either one or two beings (men or angels) dressed in bright robes. [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Mark#16:9|Mark 16:9]] and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/John#20:15|John 20:15]] indicate that Jesus appears to [[Mary Magdalene]] first, and [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#24:1|Luke 24:1]] states that she is one of the [[myrrhbearers]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=521–530}}{{sfn|Cox|Easley|2007|pp=216–226}}

After the discovery of the empty tomb, Jesus makes a series of appearances to the disciples.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=521–530}} These include the [[Doubting Thomas]] episode and the [[Road to Emmaus appearance|appearance on the road to Emmaus]], where Jesus meets two disciples. The [[catch of 153 fish]] is a miracle by the Sea of Galilee, after which Jesus encourages Peter to serve his followers.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=521–530}}{{sfn|Cox|Easley|2007|pp=216–226}}

Before he ascends into heaven, Jesus [[Great Commission|commissions his disciples]] to spread his teachings to all the nations of the world. [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#24:51|Luke 24:51]] states that Jesus is then "carried up into heaven". The Ascension account is elaborated in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Acts#1:1|Acts 1:1–11]] and mentioned in [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Timothy#3:16|1 Timothy 3:16]]. In Acts, forty days after the Resurrection, as the disciples look on, "he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight". [[s:Bible (American Standard)/1 Peter#3:22|1 Peter 3:22]] states that Jesus has "gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God".{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=521–530}}

{{see also|Biblical criticism}}

Prior to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the gospels were usually regarded as accurate historical accounts, but since then scholars have emerged who question the reliability of the gospels and draw a distinction between the Jesus described in the gospels and the Jesus of history.{{sfn|Levine|2006|p=5}} Since the 18th century, three separate scholarly quests for the historical Jesus have taken place, each with distinct characteristics and based on different research criteria, which were often developed during the quest that applied them.{{sfn|Witherington|1997|pp=9–13}}{{sfn|Powell|1998|pp=19–23}} Scholars have studied and debated a number of issues concerning the historical Jesus, such as his existence, the origins and historical reliability of the gospels and other sources, and the precise portrait of the historical figure.

The [[Christ myth theory]], which questions the existence of Jesus, appeared in the 18th century.

Approaches to the historical reconstruction of the life of Jesus have varied from the "maximalist" approaches of the 19th century, in which the gospel accounts were accepted as reliable evidence wherever it is possible, to the "minimalist" approaches of the early 20th century, where hardly anything about Jesus was accepted as historical.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Historical Jesus of the Gospels|first= Craig S.|last= Keener |year= 2012 | isbn= 978-0-8028-6292-1 |publisher=William B.

Most modern scholars consider Jesus' baptism and crucifixion to be definite historical facts. [[James Dunn (theologian)|James D.G.

{{Main|Religious perspectives on Jesus}}
Apart from his own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day generally rejected him as the Messiah, as do the great majority of Jews today. Christian theologians, [[ecumenical council]]s, reformers and others have written extensively about Jesus over the centuries. [[Christian sect]]s and [[Christian schisms|schisms]] have often been defined or characterized by their descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, [[Manichaeans]], Gnostics, Muslims, Baha'is, and others have found prominent places for Jesus in their religions.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|editor-last=Bockmuehl |editor-first= Markus N.
