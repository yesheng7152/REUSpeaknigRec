'''Laotian–Chinese relations''' refers to the [[bilateralism|current and historical relationship]] between [[Laos]] and [[China]]. Relations have consisted of [[trade]] and [[aid]], largely in [[road]] construction in the northern provinces of Laos, without directly challenging the interests of [[Thailand]] or [[Vietnam]] in the central and southern regions. However, Vietnam's invasion of [[Cambodia]] in December 1978 to unseat the [[Khmer Rouge]] regime provoked China into a limited invasion of Vietnam—approximately nineteen kilometers deep—to &quot;teach Vietnam a lesson.&quot; Laos was caught in a dangerous bind, not wanting to further provoke China, but not able to oppose its special partner, Vietnam. The Laotian leadership survived the dilemma by making slightly delayed pronouncements in support of Vietnam after some intraparty debate and by sharply reducing [[diplomatic relations]] with China to the [[chargé d'affaires]] level—without a full break. The low point in Sino-Laotian relations came in 1979, with reports of Chinese assistance and training of Hmong resistance forces under General [[Vang Pao]] in China's [[Yunnan Province]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=cs</attr><inner>Brown, MacAlister and Joseph J.

This hostile relationship gradually softened, however, and in 1989 Prime Minister [[Kaysone Phomvihane]] paid a state visit to [[Beijing]]. In 1991 Kaysone chose to spend his vacation in China rather than make his customary visit to the [[Soviet Union]]. Diplomatic and party-to-party relations were normalized in 1989. Trade expanded from the local sale of consumer goods to the granting of eleven investment licenses in 1991—including an automotive assembly plant. Following the establishment of the Laotian-Chinese Joint Border Committee in 1991, meetings held during 1992 resulted in an agreement delineating their common border. China's commercial investments and trade with Laos expanded quietly, but not dramatically, in 1993 and 1994.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=cs</attr></ext>
