'''Folding@home''' ('''FAH''' or '''F@h''') is a [[distributed computing]] project for disease research that simulates [[protein folding]], computational [[drug design]], and other types of [[molecular dynamics]]. The project uses the [[Idle (CPU)|idle processing resources]] of thousands of [[personal computers]] owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. Its primary purpose is to determine the mechanisms of protein folding, which is the process by which [[protein]]s reach their [[protein tertiary structure|final three-dimensional structure]], and to examine the causes of [[protein misfolding]]. This is of significant academic interest with major implications for [[medical research]] into [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Huntington's disease]], and many forms of [[cancer]], among other diseases. To a lesser extent, Folding@home also tries to [[protein structure prediction|predict]] a protein's [[native state|final structure]] and determine how other molecules may [[Protein–ligand docking|interact]] with it, which has applications in drug design. Folding@home is developed and operated by the Pande laboratory at [[Stanford University]], under the direction of [[Vijay Pande]], and is shared by various scientific institutions and research laboratories across the world.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;About FAH&quot;</attr></ext>

The project has pioneered the use of [[GPU]]s, [[PlayStation&amp;nbsp;3]]s, and [[Message Passing Interface]] (used for computing on [[multi-core processor]]s) for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical [[simulation]] methodology that is a [[paradigm shift]] from traditional computational approaches.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002&quot;</attr></ext> As part of the [[client-server]] [[network architecture]], the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's [[database server]]s where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.

Folding@home is one of the world's fastest computing systems, with a speed of approximately 40 [[FLOPS|petaFLOPS]]:<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>http://folding.stanford.edu/home/the-science</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> greater than all projects running on the [[BOINC]] distributed computing platform combined. This performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run [[computationally expensive]] atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than previously achieved. Since its launch on October&amp;nbsp;1, 2000, the Pande lab has produced 114&amp;nbsp;[[Academic publishing|scientific research papers]] as a direct result of Folding@home.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;papers&quot;</attr></ext> Results from the project's simulations agree favorably with experiments.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1021/ja9090353&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1073/pnas.1003962107&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1038/nature01160&quot;</attr></ext>

[[File:Protein folding.png|thumb|300px|A protein before and after folding. It starts in an unstable [[random coil]] state and finishes in its native state conformation.]]

[[Protein]]s are an essential component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within [[cell (biology)|biological cell]]s. They often act as [[enzymes]], performing biochemical reactions including [[cell signaling]], molecular transportation, and [[Cell cycle#Regulation of eukaryotic cell cycle|cellular regulation]]. As structural elements, some proteins act as a type of [[cytoskeleton|skeleton for cells]], and as [[antibodies]], while other proteins participate in the [[immune system]]. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional [[Protein tertiary structure|three-dimensional structure]], a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its [[amino acid]] sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e. its [[native state]]. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a &quot;holy grail&quot; of [[computational biology]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000452&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1126/science.309.5731.78b&quot;</attr></ext> Despite folding occurring within a [[macromolecular crowding|crowded cellular environment]], it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may [[protein misfolding|misfold]] — that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms are capable of destroying or refolding such misfolded proteins, they can subsequently [[Protein aggregation|aggregate]] and cause a variety of debilitating diseases.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1002/iub.117&quot;</attr></ext> Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computational models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1016/j.cbpa.2008.02.011&quot;</attr></ext>

Due to the complexity of proteins' [[configuration space|conformation space]] — the set of possible shapes a protein can take — and limitations in computational power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1016/j.abb.2007.05.014&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1146/annurev.biophys.34.040204.144447&quot;</attr></ext> before 2010 simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1021/ja9090353&quot;</attr></ext> General-purpose [[supercomputer]]s have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically expensive and typically shared among many research groups. Additionally, because the computations in kinetic models are serial in nature, strong [[scalability|scaling]] of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;978-1-58603-796-3&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1002/bip.10219&quot;</attr></ext> Moreover, as protein folding is a [[stochastic process]] and can statistically vary over time, it is computationally challenging to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1137/06065146X&quot;</attr></ext>

[[File:ACBP MSM from Folding@home.tiff|left|thumb|400px|Folding@home uses [[Markov state model]]s, like the one diagrammed here, to model the possible shapes and folding pathways a protein can take as it condenses from its initial randomly coiled state (left) into its native 3-D structure (right).]]
Protein folding does not occur in a single step.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1002/iub.117&quot;</attr></ext> Instead, proteins spend the majority of their folding time — nearly 96% in some cases<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1016/j.sbi.2011.12.001&quot;</attr></ext> — &quot;waiting&quot; in various intermediate [[protein conformation|conformational]] states, each a local [[thermodynamic free energy]] minimum in the protein's [[energy landscape]]. Through a process known as [[adaptive sampling]], these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a [[Hidden Markov model|Markov state model]] (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are [[discrete-time]] [[master equation]] models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model approach significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on [[GPUGRID]]) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Simulation FAQ&quot;</attr></ext> The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e. the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear [[parallelization]], leading to an approximately four [[orders of magnitude]] reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's [[phase space]] (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e. routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1016/j.ymeth.2010.06.002&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1016/j.sbi.2010.10.006&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1021/ct900620b&quot;</attr></ext>

Between 2000 and 2010, the length of the proteins Folding@home has studied have increased by a factor of four, while its timescales for protein folding simulations have increased by six orders of magnitude.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;typepad: how far FAH has come&quot;</attr></ext> In 2002, Folding@home used Markov state models to complete approximately a million [[CPU]] days of simulations over the span of several months,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1038/nature01160&quot;</attr></ext> and in 2011, MSMs parallelized another simulation that required an aggregate 10&amp;nbsp;million CPU hours of computation.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1073/pnas.1010880108&quot;</attr></ext> In January 2010, Folding@home used MSMs to simulate the dynamics of the slow-folding 32-[[amino acid|residue]] NTL9 protein out to 1.52&amp;nbsp;milliseconds, a timescale consistent with experimental folding rate predictions but a thousand times longer than previously achieved.

This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a [[ribosome|ribosomal]] exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;forum: 7808/7809 to FAH&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1073/pnas.0608256104&quot;</attr></ext> Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical [[denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturants]] to unfold proteins from their stable native state.

[[Alzheimer's disease]] is an incurable [[neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] disease which most often affects the elderly and accounts for more than half of all cases of [[dementia]]. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a [[proteopathy|protein misfolding disease]]. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic [[protein aggregation|aggregations]] of the [[amyloid beta]] (Aβ) [[peptide]], caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger [[senile plaques]], a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.2119/2007-00100.Irvine&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1001/archneurol.2007.56&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1074/jbc.R800036200&quot;</attr></ext> Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental techniques such as [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[NMR]] have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are extremely computationally demanding due to their size and complexity.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1063/1.3010881&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1371/journal.pone.0021776&quot;</attr></ext>

Previous studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds — Folding@home was able to simulate Aβ folding for six orders of magnitude longer than previously possible.

More than half of all known cancers involve [[mutations]] of [[p53]], a [[tumor suppressor]] protein present in every cell which regulates the [[cell cycle]] and signals for [[cell death]] in the event of damage to [[DNA]].

[[Interleukin 2]] (IL-2) is a protein that helps [[T cell]]s of the [[immune system]] attack pathogens and tumors. Unfortunately, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as [[pulmonary edema]]. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth.

This is most commonly due to a mutation in [[Type-I collagen]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16051-0&quot;</attr></ext> which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in [[mammal]]s.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;978-0-387-73905-2&quot;</attr></ext> The mutation causes a deformation in [[Collagen helix|collagen's triple helix structure]], which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1016/j.bpj.2009.04.059&quot;</attr></ext> In 2005, Folding@home tested a new [[quantum mechanical]] technique that improved upon previous simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computational studies of collagen.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1002/jcc.20301&quot;</attr></ext> Although researchers have used Folding@home to study collagen folding and misfolding, the interest stands as a pilot project compared to Alzheimer's and Huntington's research.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;diseases FAQ&quot;</attr></ext>

<h level="3" i="8">=== Drug design ===</h>
[[Drug]]s function by [[ligand binding|binding]] to [[binding site|specific locations]] on target molecules and causing a certain desired change, such as disabling the target or causing a [[conformational change]]. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, it is difficult to precisely determine where and [[binding affinity|how tightly]] two molecules will bind. Due to limitations in computational power, current ''[[in silico]]'' approaches usually have to trade speed for [[accuracy]]; e.g. use rapid [[protein docking]] methods instead of computationally expensive [[free energy calculation]]s. Folding@home's computational performance allows researchers to use both techniques, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Press FAQ&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;typepad: drug design methods&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1063/1.2221680&quot;</attr></ext> Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1093/bib/bbp023&quot;</attr></ext> In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the [[villin]] protein to within 1.8 [[angstrom|Å]] RMSD ([[root mean square deviation]]) from the [[crystalline structure]] experimentally determined through [[X-ray crystallography]].

Chemical activity occurs along a protein's [[active site]]. Traditional drug design approaches involve tightly binding to this site and blocking its activity, under the assumption that the target protein exists in a single rigid structure. However, this approach only works for approximately 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain [[allosteric site]]s which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very [[computationally expensive]]. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, [[interleukin-2]], and [[RNase H]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;typepad: drug targets&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1073/pnas.1209309109&quot;</attr></ext>

Approximately half of all known [[antibiotic]]s interfere with the workings of a bacteria's [[ribosome]], a large and complex biochemical machine that performs [[protein biosynthesis]] by [[translation (biology)|translating]] [[messenger RNA]] into proteins. [[Macrolide antibiotics]] clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins.

In addition to reporting active processors, Folding@home determines its computing performance as measured in floating point operations per second ([[FLOPS]]) based on the actual execution time of its calculations. Originally this was reported as native FLOPS: the raw performance from each given type of processing hardware.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;FLOPS FAQ&quot;</attr></ext> In March 2009 Folding@home began reporting the performance in native and x86 FLOPS,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;typepad: FLOPS&quot;</attr></ext> the latter being an estimation of how many FLOPS the calculation would take on a standard [[x86]] CPU architecture, which is commonly used as a performance reference.

<h level="2" i="12">== Software ==</h>
Folding@home software at the user's end involves three primary components: work units, cores, and a client.

<h level="3" i="13">=== Work units ===</h>
A work unit is the protein data that the client is asked to process. Work units are a fraction of the simulation between the states in a Markov state model. After the work unit has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer's computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the credit points.  This cycle repeats automatically.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922&quot;</attr></ext> All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding is serial in nature and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium&amp;nbsp;3 450&amp;nbsp;MHz CPU with [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE).<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Main FAQ&quot;</attr></ext> However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as a major part of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;SMP FAQ&quot;</attr></ext>

Before public release, work units go through several [[quality assurance]] steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;typepad: more transparency&quot;</attr></ext> Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, except in the rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;forum: Gromacs cannot continue&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;forum: 6803(4,66,255)&quot;</attr></ext> The Folding@home support forum can be used to differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;forum: troubleshooting bad WUs&quot;</attr></ext>

<h level="3" i="14">=== Cores ===</h>
<template lineStart="1"><title>main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>List of Folding@home cores</value></part></template>
Specialized molecular dynamics programs, referred to as &quot;FahCores&quot; and often abbreviated &quot;cores&quot;, perform the calculations on the work unit as a [[background process]]. A large majority of Folding@home's cores are based on [[GROMACS]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922&quot;</attr></ext> one of the fastest and most popular molecular dynamics software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized [[assembly code]] and hardware optimizations.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1002/jcc.20703&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1021/ct700301q&quot;</attr></ext> Although GROMACS is [[open-source software]] and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a [[closed-source]] license to help ensure data validity.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gromacs FAQ&quot;</attr></ext> Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN.

After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to [[uniprocessor]] and [[multi-core processor]]s systems, as well as [[graphics processing unit]]s. The diversity and power of each [[hardware architecture]] provides Folding@home with the ability to efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value.

<h level="4" i="16">==== Graphics processing units ====</h>
The specialized hardware of [[GPU]]s is designed to accelerate rendering of 3-D&amp;nbsp;graphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for certain types of calculations. GPUs are one of the most powerful and rapidly growing computational platforms and many scientists and researchers are pursuing [[GPGPU|general purpose GPU]] (GPGPU) computing. However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01012.x&quot;</attr></ext> Such customization is challenging, especially to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the [[open source]] [[OpenMM]] [[library (computing)|library]], which uses a [[bridge pattern|bridge design pattern]] with two [[application programming interface]] (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations do not require significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1002/jcc.21209&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1109/MCSE.2010.27&quot;</attr></ext>

Before 2010 the computational reliability of GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely unknown, and circumstantial evidence related to the lack of built-in [[error detection and correction]] in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000&amp;nbsp;hosts on the Folding@home network detected [[soft error]]s in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware characteristics, such as software-side error detection.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1109/CCGRID.2010.84&quot;</attr></ext>

From March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took advantage of the computing power of [[PlayStation 3]]s. At the time of its inception, its main [[stream processing|streaming]] [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell processor]] delivered a 20x speed increase over PCs for certain calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the [[Xbox 360]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Press FAQ&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Biotech 27&quot;</attr></ext> The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to [[Amdahl's law]], and significantly changed the tradeoff between computational efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing for the use of more complex molecular models at little additional computational cost.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1002/jcc.21054&quot;</attr></ext> This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise computationally infeasible.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;cnn ps3&quot;</attr></ext>

The PS3 client was developed in a collaborative effort between [[Sony]] and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March&amp;nbsp;23, 2007.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Press FAQ&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;PS3 to study cancer&quot;</attr></ext> Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;PS3 research project&quot;</attr></ext> On September&amp;nbsp;18 of the following year, the PS3 client became a channel of [[Life with PlayStation]] on its launch.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Life With PS3 live&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;typepad: life with PS&quot;</attr></ext> In terms of the types of calculations it can perform, at the time of its introduction the client took the middle ground between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5160922&quot;</attr></ext> However, unlike CPUs and GPUs, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;cnn ps3&quot;</attr></ext> The PS3's uniform console environment made [[technical support|support]] easier and made Folding@home more [[user friendly]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Press FAQ&quot;</attr></ext> The PS3 also has the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizations of the current protein dynamics.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1002/jcc.21054&quot;</attr></ext>

On November 6, 2012, Sony concluded support for the Folding@home PS3 client and other services available under Life with PlayStation. Over its lifetime of five years and 7 months, more than 15 million users contributed over 100 million hours of computation to Folding@home, greatly assisting the project with disease research. Following discussions with the Pande lab, Sony decided to terminate the application. Pande considers the PlayStation 3 client a &quot;game changer&quot; for the project.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;PS3 FAQ&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;PS3 4.30 update, drop F@h&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;LWP termination&quot;</attr></ext>

<h level="4" i="18">==== Multi-core processing client ====</h>
Folding@home can use the [[parallel processing]] capabilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completion of the overall folding simulation much faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This approach is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in the same amount of time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;typepad: what does SMP do&quot;</attr></ext> A 2007 publication in the ''[[Journal of Molecular Biology]]'' relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the [[villin]] protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;10.1016/j.jmb.2007.09.069&quot;</attr></ext>

In November 2006, first-generation [[symmetric multiprocessing]] (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, referred to as SMP1.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;High-Per FAQ&quot;</attr></ext> These clients used [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as at that time the GROMACS cores were [[Thread-safe|not designed]] to be used with multiple threads.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;SMP FAQ&quot;</attr></ext> This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;typepad: new client dev&quot;</attr></ext> Although the clients performed well in [[Unix]]-based operating systems such as Linux and Mac OS X, they were troublesome under [[Windows]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;typepad: what does SMP do&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;typepad: new client dev&quot;</attr></ext> On January&amp;nbsp;24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]-based implementation.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;SMP2 release&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;typepad: how does dev get done&quot;</attr></ext>

SMP2 supports a trial of a special category of &quot;bigadv&quot; work units, designed for simulating proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive and have a great scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;bigadv&quot;</attr></ext> which was later increased on February&amp;nbsp;7, 2012 to sixteen CPU cores.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;typepad: update on bigadv-16&quot;</attr></ext> In addition to these additional hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as [[RAM]] and [[Internet bandwidth]]. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;typepad: bigadv points change&quot;</attr></ext> The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run particularly demanding simulations on long timescales that had previously required the use of supercomputing [[Computer cluster#Compute clusters|clusters]] and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;bigadv&quot;</attr></ext> Many users with hardware capable of running bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Vijay Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://folding.stanford.edu/home/revised-plans-for-bigadv-ba-experiment/ |title=Revised plans for BigAdv (BA) experiment |author=Vijay Pande |date=January 15, 2014 |accessdate=October 6, 2014}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

V7 consists of four integrated elements.

FAHControl directs FAHClient — a [[back-end]] application that in turn manages each FAHSlot (or &quot;slot&quot;). Each slot acts as replacement for the previously distinct Folding@home v6 uniprocessor, SMP, or GPU computer clients, as it can download, process, and upload work units independently. The FAHViewer function, modeled after the PS3's viewer, displays a real-time 3-D rendering, if available, of the protein currently being processed.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;V7 install guide&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;typepad: V7 in open beta&quot;</attr></ext>

In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-[[microsecond|µs]] Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis.
