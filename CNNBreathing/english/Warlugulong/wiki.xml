'''''Warlugulong''''' (1977) is an [[acrylic paint|acrylic]] on canvas painting by [[Indigenous Australian]] artist [[Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri]].<template><title>#tag:ref</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Tjapaltjarri (in Western Desert dialects) is a [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|skin name]], one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the [[kinship system]] of central Australian Indigenous people.

[[File:Warlugulong - Zoom.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Detail showing the skeleton of one of Lungkata's sons, against a background representing smoke and ashes]]
While the painting has been described as showing the story of an ancestral being called Lungkata starting the first [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfire]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Genocchio&quot;</attr></ext> it portrays elements of nine distinct dreamings, of which Lungkata's tale is the central motif. Lungkata was the [[Blue-tongued skink|Blue-Tongue Lizard]] Man, an ancestral figure responsible for creating bushfire. The painting portrays the results of a fire, caused by Lungkata to punish his two sons who did not share with their father the kangaroo they had caught. The sons' skeletons are on the right hand side of the image, shown against a background representing smoke and ashes.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Cubillo&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book|editors=Cubillo, Franchesca and Wally Caruana|title=Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander Art: Collection Highlights|year=2010|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|location=Canberra|pages=58–59|isbn=978-0-642-33414-5}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Around this central motif are arranged elements of eight other stories, all of them represented at least in part by sets of footprints. Human footprints include a set left by dancing women from a place called Aileron; another shows a family group travelling to a place called Ngama, and a third trail is that of a Tjungurrayi man, which lead to his skeleton, representing his death after committing the crime of trying to steal sacred items. Animal representations include tracks of a cluster of emus from a place called Napperby, on the artist's country, as well as those left by the rock wallaby, or Mala, men journeying north from Port Augusta in South Australia, as well as, on the left hand edge of the picture, those of two groups of dingoes going to a place called Warrabri. A little closer to the centre of the painting are marks representing a dreaming called the Chase of the Goanna Men. Throughout the work, Upambura the Possum Man's footsteps follow the wandering lines that give the painting its overall structure.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Cubillo&quot;</attr></ext>

This work excludes elements of several dreamings associated with country further south, which had been included in the painting created by Clifford Possum and his brother a year earlier. The omission led scholar [[Vivien Johnson]] to conclude that ''Warlugulong'' (1977) portrays a narrower geographic area than the preceding work.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Johnson2003&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Vivien|title=Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri|publisher=Art Gallery of South Australia|location=Adelaide, SA|year=2003|pages=94–99|isbn=978-0-7308-3053-5}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The artist also modified some of the iconography, and limited the explanations of the painting, omitting secret-sacred dimensions of the stories to avoid offending other Indigenous men, and in recognition that most of the audience for the work would be uninitiated non-Indigenous people.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Johnson2003&quot;</attr></ext>

Johnson's analysis of the painting emphasises the relationship between the representation of geographical sites in the [[Yuendumu]] region and the dreaming stories associated with those sites. She concludes that there is &quot;a topographic rationale for the order in which the Dreamings appear from left to right (that is, east to west) across the painting [as well as for] the transverse Dreaming trails&quot;. However, beyond this general principle, she argues that the layout of symbols and images is influenced by the desire to present a symmetrical work. There is greater visual symmetry in this painting than in its 1976 predecessor; symmetry is a strong influence in the works of many of the early Western Desert artists, including Clifford Possum, [[Billy Stockman Tjapaltjarri]] and [[Kaapa Tjampitjinpa]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Johnson2003&quot;</attr></ext>
