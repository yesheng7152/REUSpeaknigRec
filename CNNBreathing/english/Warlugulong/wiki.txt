'''''Warlugulong''''' (1977) is an [[acrylic paint|acrylic]] on canvas painting by [[Indigenous Australian]] artist [[Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri]].{{#tag:ref|Tjapaltjarri (in Western Desert dialects) is a [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|skin name]], one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the [[kinship system]] of central Australian Indigenous people.

Although they may be used as terms of address, they are not surnames in the sense used by Europeans.<ref name="CLC">{{cite web|url=http://www.clc.org.au/People_Culture/kinship/kinship.html|title=Kinship and skin names|work=People and culture|publisher=Central Land Council|accessdate=23 October 2009|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clc.org.au%2FPeople_Culture%2Fkinship%2Fkinship.html&date=2010-10-11|archivedate=12 October 2010}}</ref><ref name="de Brabander">{{cite book|last=De Brabander|first=Dallas|title=[[Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia]]|editor=David Horton|publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press for the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|location=Canberra, ACT|year=1994|volume=2|page=977|chapter=Sections|isbn=978-0-85575-234-7}}</ref> Thus Clifford Possum is the element of the artist's name that is specifically his.|group=notes}} Owned for many years by the [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia]], the work was sold by art dealer Hank Ebes on 24&nbsp;July&nbsp;2007, setting a record price for a [[contemporary Indigenous Australian art]] work bought at auction when it was purchased by the [[National Gallery of Australia]] for A$2.4&nbsp;million. The painting illustrates the story of an ancestral being called Lungkata, together with eight other [[Dreaming (spirituality)|dreamings]] associated with localities about which Clifford Possum had traditional knowledge. It exemplifies a distinctive painting style developed by [[Papunya Tula]] artists in the 1970s, and blends representation of landscape with ceremonial [[iconography]].

==Background==
[[Contemporary Indigenous Australian art]] originated with the [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous]] men of [[Papunya]], located around {{convert|240|km|mi}} northwest of Alice Springs in Australia's [[Western Desert cultural bloc|Western Desert]], who began painting in 1971.<ref name="Bardon">{{cite book|last1=Bardon|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Bardon|first2=James |title=Papunya – A place made after the story: The beginnings of the Western Desert painting movement|publisher=The Miegunyah Press & University of Melbourne|location=Melbourne, VIC|year=2007|isbn=978-0-522-85434-3}}</ref> The youngest was [[Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri]], encouraged by his older brother [[Tim Leura Tjapaltjarri]].<ref name="McCulloch136">{{cite book|last1=McCulloch|first1=Alan|first2=Susan last2=McCulloch|first3= Emily|last3= McCulloch Childs|title=The new McCulloch's Encyclopedia of Australian Art|page=136|publisher=Aus Art Editions in association with The Miegunyah Press|location=Fitzroy, VIC|year=2006|isbn=0-522-85317-X}}</ref> A number of the men developed a distinctive style of narrative painting that, beginning around 1976, resulted in the production of several "monumental" works that included representations of both their [[Indigenous land rights|traditional lands]] and of ceremonial [[iconography]].<ref name="Desert art214">{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Vivien|title=The Oxford Companion to Aboriginal Art and Culture|editor=Sylvia Kleinert and Margo Neale|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, VIC|year=2000|page=214|chapter=Desert art|isbn=0-19-550649-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Caruana|first=Wally|year=2003 |title=Aboriginal Art|edition=2nd |location=London |publisher= Thames & Hudson|isbn=978-0-500-20366-8|pages=124–125}}</ref> Clifford Possum was the first to make this transition commencing with a related painting, also titled ''Warlugulong'' (1976), now held by the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]].<ref name="NGA07">{{cite journal|last=Croft|first=Brenda|year=2007|title=New Acquisition: Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri 'Warlugulong'|journal=Artonview|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|issue=52|pages=44–45}}</ref> The two images are amongst five that the artist created between 1976 and 1979 that linked images of sacred stories to geographic representation of his country – the land to which he belonged and about which he had traditional knowledge.<ref name="Cubillo"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Glossary-Indigenous-Australia-terms|title=Glossary of Indigenous Australia terms|date=2009|publisher=Australian Museum|accessdate=15 May 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130524135255/http://australianmuseum.net.au/Glossary-Indigenous-Australia-terms|archivedate=24 May 2013}}</ref> The artist's images of this period are visually complex, and contain a wide variety of patterns, unified by strong background motifs and structure.<ref name="AC2004">{{cite journal|last=McCulloch|first=Susan|date=April–June 2004|title=Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri: Larger than Life|journal=Art Collector|volume=28|pages=111–113|url=http://www.artcollector.net.au/CliffordPossumTjapaltjarriLargerthanLife|accessdate=4 April 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140407095533/http://www.artcollector.net.au/CliffordPossumTjapaltjarriLargerthanLife|archivedate=7 April 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Warlugulong - Zoom.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Detail showing the skeleton of one of Lungkata's sons, against a background representing smoke and ashes]]
While the painting has been described as showing the story of an ancestral being called Lungkata starting the first [[Bushfires in Australia|bushfire]],<ref name="Genocchio"/> it portrays elements of nine distinct dreamings, of which Lungkata's tale is the central motif. Lungkata was the [[Blue-tongued skink|Blue-Tongue Lizard]] Man, an ancestral figure responsible for creating bushfire. The painting portrays the results of a fire, caused by Lungkata to punish his two sons who did not share with their father the kangaroo they had caught. The sons' skeletons are on the right hand side of the image, shown against a background representing smoke and ashes.<ref name="Cubillo">{{cite book|editors=Cubillo, Franchesca and Wally Caruana|title=Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art: Collection Highlights|year=2010|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|location=Canberra|pages=58–59|isbn=978-0-642-33414-5}}</ref>

Around this central motif are arranged elements of eight other stories, all of them represented at least in part by sets of footprints. Human footprints include a set left by dancing women from a place called Aileron; another shows a family group travelling to a place called Ngama, and a third trail is that of a Tjungurrayi man, which lead to his skeleton, representing his death after committing the crime of trying to steal sacred items. Animal representations include tracks of a cluster of emus from a place called Napperby, on the artist's country, as well as those left by the rock wallaby, or Mala, men journeying north from Port Augusta in South Australia, as well as, on the left hand edge of the picture, those of two groups of dingoes going to a place called Warrabri. A little closer to the centre of the painting are marks representing a dreaming called the Chase of the Goanna Men. Throughout the work, Upambura the Possum Man's footsteps follow the wandering lines that give the painting its overall structure.<ref name="Cubillo"/>

This work excludes elements of several dreamings associated with country further south, which had been included in the painting created by Clifford Possum and his brother a year earlier. The omission led scholar [[Vivien Johnson]] to conclude that ''Warlugulong'' (1977) portrays a narrower geographic area than the preceding work.<ref name="Johnson2003">{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Vivien|title=Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri|publisher=Art Gallery of South Australia|location=Adelaide, SA|year=2003|pages=94–99|isbn=978-0-7308-3053-5}}</ref> The artist also modified some of the iconography, and limited the explanations of the painting, omitting secret-sacred dimensions of the stories to avoid offending other Indigenous men, and in recognition that most of the audience for the work would be uninitiated non-Indigenous people.<ref name="Johnson2003"/>

Johnson's analysis of the painting emphasises the relationship between the representation of geographical sites in the [[Yuendumu]] region and the dreaming stories associated with those sites. She concludes that there is "a topographic rationale for the order in which the Dreamings appear from left to right (that is, east to west) across the painting [as well as for] the transverse Dreaming trails". However, beyond this general principle, she argues that the layout of symbols and images is influenced by the desire to present a symmetrical work. There is greater visual symmetry in this painting than in its 1976 predecessor; symmetry is a strong influence in the works of many of the early Western Desert artists, including Clifford Possum, [[Billy Stockman Tjapaltjarri]] and [[Kaapa Tjampitjinpa]].<ref name="Johnson2003"/>

==Sale history==
''Warlugulong'' was first exhibited at a show in Alice Springs, where it attracted crowds of interested viewers, but failed to sell.
