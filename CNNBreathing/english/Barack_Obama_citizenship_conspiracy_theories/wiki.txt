During [[Barack Obama]]'s campaign for president and in the years following his election, many [[conspiracy theories]] have been circulated, asserting that he is not a [[Natural-born-citizen clause of the U.S. Constitution|natural-born citizen of the United States]] and consequently, under [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article Two of the U.S. Constitution]], is ineligible to be President of the United States.

Theories allege that Obama's published [[birth certificate]] is a forgery—that his actual birthplace is not Hawaii but [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]]. Other theories allege that Obama became a citizen of [[Indonesia]] in childhood, thereby losing his U.S. citizenship. Still others claim that Obama is not a natural-born U.S. citizen because he was born a [[multiple citizenship|dual citizen]] (British and American). Some political commentators have characterized these various claims as a [[racism|racist]] reaction to Obama's status as the first African American president of the United States.<ref name="racism">{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2011/apr/27/barack-obama-obama-administration|date=April 27, 2011|first=Michael|last=Tomasky|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=July 20, 2011|title=Birthers and the persistence of racial paranoia}}

===Origins of the claims===
During the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 presidential primaries]], anonymous e-mails from supporters of Hillary Clinton surfaced that questioned Obama's citizenship in an attempt to revive Clinton's faltering [[primary election]] campaign. These and numerous other chain e-mails during the subsequent presidential election circulated false rumors about Obama's origin, religion and birth certificate.<ref>{{Cite news|title=For True Disbelievers, The Facts Are Just Not Enough|first=Amy|last=Hollyfield|work=[[St. Petersburg Times]]|date=June 29, 2008|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/8406|publisher=Pulitzer Prize website|accessdate=March 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Birtherism: Where it all began|first=Ben|last=Smith|work=[[Politico]]|date=April 22, 2011|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/53563.html|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|accessdate=April 22, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110501045531/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/53563.html|archivedate=May 01 2011 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>

Frequent arguments of those questioning Obama's eligibility related to the fact that he did not originally release a copy of his "original" or "long form" birth certificate, but rather a "short form" version that did not include all of the information given on 1961 Hawaii-issued birth certificates. It was claimed that the use of the term "certification of live birth" on the first document means it is not equivalent to a "birth certificate".

====Rejection by conspiracy theorists====
The release of the certificate in 2008 resulted in a fresh round of questions.

It's a fake document that's on the Web site right now, and the original birth certificate the campaign refuses to produce."<ref name="factcheck"/> This view was rejected by [[FactCheck.org]], which viewed the Obama campaign's hard copy of the Certification of Live Birth and reported that:

{{quote|FactCheck.org staffers have now seen, touched, examined and photographed the original birth certificate.

Joshua Wisch, a spokesman for the Hawaii Attorney General's office, stated in 2011 that the original "long form" birth certificate&nbsp;— described by Hawaiian officials as a "record of live birth" kept in the archives of the Hawaii Department of Health is "... a Department of Health record and it can't be released to anybody", including President Obama. Wisch added that state law does not authorize photocopying such records.<ref name="AG"/>

===Long form, 2011===
On April 22, 2011, Obama asked Loretta Fuddy, director of the Hawaii Department of Health, for certified copies of his original Certificate of Live Birth ("long-form birth certificate").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/birth-certificate-correspondence.pdf|title=Correspondence with the Hawaii State Department of Health|accessdate=April 27, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110502024801/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/birth-certificate-correspondence.pdf|archivedate=May 02 2011 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> Accompanying the letter was a written request from Judith Corley, Obama's personal counsel, requesting a waiver of the department's policy of issuing only computer-generated certificates. Corley stated that granting the waiver would relieve the department of the burden of repeated inquiries into the President's birth records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/gov/newsroom/press-releases/AttachmentsToCertificateOfLiveBirthRelease.pdf|title=Attachments to Certificate of Live Birth Release|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2012|url=http://hawaii.gov/gov/newsroom/press-releases/AttachmentsToCertificateOfLiveBirthRelease.pdf}}</ref>

On April 25, 2011, Fuddy approved the request and witnessed the copying process as the health department's registrar issued the certified copies. The same day, Corley personally visited the department headquarters in Honolulu to pay the required fee on Obama's behalf, and received the two requested certified copies of the original birth certificate, an accompanying letter from Fuddy attesting to the authenticity of same, and a receipt for the processing fee. Fuddy said that she had granted the exception to its normal policy of issuing only computer-generated copies by virtue of Obama's status, in an effort to avoid ongoing requests for the birth certificate.<ref>{{Cite news|work=USA Today|first=David|last=Jackson|date=April 27, 2011|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/04/obama-releases-birth-records/1|title=Obama releases his Hawaii birth certificate}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=71462e6edb79c23595f73fe38&id=9d8904b9d5|title=Hawaii Health Department Grants President Obama's Request for Certified Copies of 'Long Form' Birth Certificate|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}</ref>

==False claims==

===Born in Kenya===
Some opponents of Obama's presidential eligibility claim that he was born in Kenya, and was therefore not born a United States citizen.

Whether Obama having been born outside the U.S. would have invalidated his U.S. citizenship at birth is debated. Andrew Malcolm, of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', has argued that Obama would still be eligible for the presidency, irrespective of where he was born, because his mother was an American citizen, saying that Obama's mother "could have been on Mars when wee Barry emerged and he'd still be American."<ref name=Malcolm>{{Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2009/06/barack-obama-birth-certificate.html|title=More questions about Barack Obama's birth certificate, still|last=Malcolm|first=Andrew|date=June 30, 2009|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=July 8, 2009}}</ref> A contrary view is promoted by [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] Law Professor [[Eugene Volokh]], who has said that in the hypothetical scenario that Obama was born outside the U.S., he would ''not'' be a natural-born citizen, since the then-applicable law would have required Obama's mother to have been in the U.S. at least "five years after the age of 14", but Ann Dunham was three months shy of her 19th birthday when Obama was born.<ref name=Volokh>Volokh interpreted the law differently in {{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-birth-certificate-30-oct30,0,1742172.story|title=Rumor calls Obama's birth certificate fake But his critics don't appear to have proof|last=Janega|first=James|date=October 30, 2008|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=February 1, 2011}}, but later posted a correction at {{Cite web|url=http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2008_11_30-2008_12_06.shtml#1227910730|title=Correction About Natural-Born Citizen Law|last=Volokh|first=Eugene|date=December 1, 2008|work=The Volokh Conspiracy|accessdate=July 8, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090708201948/http://volokh.com/archives/archive_2008_11_30-2008_12_06.shtml|archivedate=July 08 2009 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}<!--PLEASE NOTE: This is a legitimate reference to a blog entry.

<!-- NOTE TO EDITORS ABOUT THE SUBSECTION HEADING: there is a link in "Barack Obama presidential eligibility litigation#Keyes v. Bowen" that links here. Therefore, if you change this subsection heading, please fix the appropriate link -->
An incorrect but popularly reported claim is that his father's stepmother, [[Sarah Onyango Obama|Sarah Obama]], told [[Anabaptist]] Bishop Ron McRae in a recorded transatlantic telephone conversation that she was present when Obama was born in Kenya.

The [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy newspapers]] gave an explanation of how the story about Obama's step-grandmother began. The tape is cut off in the middle of the conversation, before the passage in which she clarifies her meaning: "'Obama was not born in [[Mombasa]]. He was born in America,' the translator says after talking to the woman. ... Another response later says, 'Obama in Hawaii. Hawaii. She says he was born in Hawaii.'"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Thomma|first=Steven|title=Here's the truth: 'Birther' claims are just plain nuts|publisher=McClatchy Newspapers|date=July 30, 2009|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/227/story/72794.html}}</ref>

Sarah Obama shed more light on the controversy in a 2007 interview with the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. In the interview, Obama's paternal step grandmother stated that six months after Barack Obama Sr. and Ann Dunham were married, she received a letter at her home in Kenya announcing the birth of Barack Obama II, who was born August 4, 1961.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Jones|first=Tim|title=Barack Obama: Mother not just a girl from Kansas|work=Hartford Courant|date=March 27, 2007|url=http://www.courant.com/news/nationworld/world/chi-0703270151mar27-archive,0,2145571.story}}{{dead link|date=December 2012|url=http://www.courant.com/news/nationworld/world/chi-0703270151mar27-archive,0,2145571.story}}</ref>

In a June 2012 interview at her Kenyan home, Sarah Obama was asked: "Some people want to believe that the president was born in Kenya. Have these people ever bothered you or asked for his birth certificate?" Her response was: "But Barack Obama wasn’t born in Kenya."<ref name=Carmon>Carmon, Irin.

====Fake Kenyan birth certificate====
On August 2, 2009, [[Orly Taitz]] released and attached to court documents a purported Kenyan birth certificate which she said, if authenticated and shown to be genuine, would significantly narrow and shorten the discovery and pre-trial litigation period in the [[Barack Obama presidential eligibility litigation#Keyes v. Bowen|''Keyes v. Bowen'']] lawsuit, in which the plaintiffs asked a judicial order that Obama provide documentation that he is a natural-born citizen of the United States. Legal papers submitted describe the document as an "unauthenticated color photocopy of certified copy of registration of birth".<ref name="CopyofKenyanDocument">{{Cite news|title=Kenyan Birth Certificate: Obama Birthers Latch On To Forgery|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/08/03/kenyan-birth-certificate_n_249850.html|first=Rachel|last=Weiner|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=August 3, 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/08/04/Birther-She-has-Obama-birth-certificate/UPI-75631249420557/ "Kenya 'birth certificate' said to be fake"], ''United Press International''. August 4, 2009.</ref>
The document was almost immediately revealed to be a forgery. It purports to have been issued by the "Republic of Kenya", when in fact, such a state did not yet exist at the time of Obama's birth as indicated on the document (Kenya was a [[Kenya Colony|British Colony]] until 1963).<ref>Snopes.com: [http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/birthers/kenyacert.asp Kenyan Mistake.] February 15, 2011.</ref>

===Not born in Hawaii===
Despite the existence of Obama's Hawaii certification of live birth, [[Barack Obama presidential eligibility litigation#Terrence Lakin|Terry Lakin's]] attorney, among others, have claimed that anyone, including foreign-born children, could acquire a Hawaiian certification of live birth, and so Obama's possession of such a certificate does not prove that he was born in Hawaii.<ref name="Cooper">{{Cite news|last=Cooper|first=Anderson|title=Release birth certificate, military doctor demands|url=http://ac360.blogs.cnn.com/2010/08/06/video-release-birth-certificate-military-doctor-demands-2/|work=CNN: Anderson Cooper 360|date=August 6, 2010|year=2010<!-- needed for link anchor-->}}</ref> However, the suggestion that this could have applied to Obama was rejected by Janice Okubo, director of communications for the Hawaii Department of Health: "If you were born in Bali, for example, you could get a certificate from the state of Hawaii saying you were born in Bali.

[[File:Obama birth announcement.jpg|thumb|left|303px|The Barack Obama birth announcement, published in ''[[The Honolulu Advertiser]]'' on August 13, 1961]]
In 1961, birth notices for Barack Obama were published in both the ''[[Honolulu Advertiser]]'' and the ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]'' on August 13 and August 14, 1961, respectively, listing the home address of Obama's parents as 6085 Kalanianaole Highway in Honolulu.<ref name="factcheck"/><ref name="honadv-09Nov08"/> On November 9, 2008, in response to the persistent rumors, the ''Advertiser'' posted on its web site a screenshot of the announcement taken from its microfilmed archives.

In an editorial published on July 29, 2009, the ''Star-Bulletin'' pointed out that both newspapers' vital-statistics columns are available on microfilm in the main state library. "Were the state Department of Health and Obama's parents really in cahoots to give false information to the newspapers, perhaps intending to clear the way for the baby to someday be elected president of the United States?" the newspaper asked.<ref>{{Cite news|date=July 29, 2009|url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/content/20090729_No_doubt_about_Obamas_birth|title=No doubt about Obama's birth|accessdate=February 27, 2011}}</ref>

===Lost U.S. citizenship===
It has been suggested that Obama obtained Indonesian citizenship (and thus may have lost U.S. citizenship) when he lived there as a child.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kornhaber|2009|p=[http://www.ocweekly.com/2009-06-18/news/orly-taitz/4 4]}}</ref> As an attempt to prove that Obama was no longer a U.S. citizen (or held dual citizenship), some claim his 1981 trip to Pakistan took place at a time when there was supposedly a ban on United States passport holders entering that country, which would in turn have required him to use a non-U.S. passport. There was in fact no such ban. A ''New York Times'' article and [[U.S. State Department]] travel advisories from 1981 make it clear that travel to Pakistan by U.S. passport holders was legal at that time.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Barbara Crossette|authorlink=Barbara Crossette|title=Lahore, a Survivor With a Bittersweet History|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/14/travel/lahore-a-survivor-with-a-bittersweet-history.html|work=The New York Times|date=June 14, 1981|accessdate=March 23, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110220094017/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/14/travel/lahore-a-survivor-with-a-bittersweet-history.html|archivedate=February 20, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="NYT_Travel">{{Cite news|title=Lahore; Letters to the Travel Editor|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/23/travel/l-lahore-243000.html?sec=&spon=&scp=3&sq=lahore%20travel%201981&st=cse|first=John S.|last=Brims|work=The New York Times|date=August 23, 1981|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}</ref><ref name="State_Advisory">{{Cite web|title=Travel Advisory No. 81-33A|publisher=U.S Department of State|date=August 17, 1981|work=Passport Services/Bureau of Consular Affairs|url=http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/ERC/travel/cis/southasia/TA_Pakistan1981.pdf|accessdate=March 23, 2011}}</ref>

An [[April Fools Day]] hoax email circulated on the Internet starting in 2009.  It falsely claimed that Obama applied to Occidental College under the name "Barry Soetoro" claiming to be "a foreign student from Indonesia" in order to obtain a Fulbright scholarship (which does not exist for undergraduate students from Indonesia).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/birthers/occidental.asp|title=The Occidental Tourist|date=2009-09-17|accessdate=2013-07-01}}</ref>

==Disputes over "natural-born citizen" requirements==
Another theory of Obama's ineligibility is that, regardless of his place of birth, he does not meet the constitutional definition of a [[natural-born citizen]].

The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] states: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States...." According to law professor [[Gabriel J. Chin]], "there is agreement that 'natural born citizens' include those made citizens by birth under the 14th Amendment."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Who's really eligible to be president?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/04/20/chin.natural.born/index.html|first=Gabriel|last=Chin|publisher=CNN|date=April 21, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/citizen.asp|title=Native Son|publisher=[[Snopes]]|date=October 17, 2008}}</ref>

Despite this agreement, two similar but distinct theories nonetheless contend Obama, although born in Hawaii, does not qualify as a "natural-born citizen":<ref name=one>{{Cite news|title=Court won't review Obama's eligibility to serve|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-obama-birth-certificate1dec08,0,7258812.story|date=December 8, 2008|accessdate=November 12, 2010|first=Tim|last=Jones|work=Chicago Tribune|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20101024151754/http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-obama-birth-certificate1dec08,0,7258812.story|archivedate=October 24, 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref><ref name="Barnes-Obama">{{Cite news|title=Obama Citizenship&nbsp;– Supreme Court Declines To Hear Challenge|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/08/AR2008120803710.html|first=Robert|last=Barnes|work=The Washington Post|date=December 2008}}</ref>

===Parental citizenship===
Some campaigners, such as the Tennessee-based Liberty Legal Foundation, contend that in order for a person to be a natural-born citizen within the meaning of Article II, Section 1, it is necessary that both parents be U.S. citizens at the time of that person's birth. Those who subscribe to this theory argue that since Obama's father was not a U.S. citizen, Obama could not have been a natural-born citizen, and is therefore ineligible to be President of the United States. The Liberty Legal Foundation has cited language in an 1875 voting rights case—''[[Minor v. Happersett]]''—in support of its claim that the U.S. Supreme Court has defined natural-born citizens as "all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/10/28/41005.htm|title=Birthers Sue Democratic National Committee|first=Jamie|last=Ross|date=October 28, 2011|work=[[Courthouse News Service]]}}</ref><ref>[http://www.libertylegalfoundation.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Federal-DNC-Complaint.pdf Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief], pp. 3, 5.</ref>

===Dual citizenship===
Others, including New Jersey attorney [[Donofrio v. Wells|Leo Donofrio]], have claimed that a person cannot be a natural-born citizen if he is a dual citizen at birth. Those who subscribe to this theory argue that because Obama's father held [[CUKC|citizenship of the UK and colonies]], and not U.S. citizenship, at the time Obama was born, Obama was born a dual citizen and therefore was not a natural-born citizen.<ref name=Barnes-Obama/>

In August 2008, the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' ran an online article asserting that Obama is both a U.S. and a Kenyan citizen.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/aug/06/things-you-might-not-know-about-barack-obama/|title=Things you might not know about Barack Obama|date=August 6, 2008|work=Rocky Mountain News|location=Denver, CO}}</ref> This turned out to be incorrect according to FactCheck.org, which noted that Obama was indeed born a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies (CUKC) under British law, by virtue of his descent from a Kenyan father at a time when Kenya was a British colony, but lost CUKC citizenship and became a Kenyan citizen when that country gained independence in 1963. However, Kenya's constitution prohibits dual citizenship in adulthood. Obama therefore automatically lost his Kenyan citizenship on his 23rd birthday, in 1984, by failing to formally renounce any non-Kenyan citizenship and swear an oath of allegiance to Kenya.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Does Barack Obama have Kenyan citizenship?|publisher=Factcheck.org|url=http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/does_barack_obama_have_kenyan_citizenship.html|first=Joe|last=Miller|date=August 29, 2008|accessdate=December 8, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081210091436/http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/does_barack_obama_have_kenyan_citizenship.html|archivedate=December 10, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> Although the paper apologized for the error and published a correction, the article continued to provide fuel for online rumors about Obama's eligibility for the presidency.

Some celebrities have promoted or touched upon the ineligibility claims, as well.

The anti-Obama campaigners have not, however, been unanimous in their approach.

In response, on July 21, 2010, ''[[The Hutchinson News]]'', a local paper in [[Hutchinson, Kansas]], withdrew their endorsement of Mann, saying that Mann "questions the citizenship of President Barack Obama despite evidence that is irrefutable to most objective, rational people&nbsp;– including a birth certificate released by the Hawaii secretary of state and birth announcements printed in Honolulu's two major newspapers".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.hutchnews.com/Editorialblogs/edit-congress-withdraw-endorsement--1|title=U.S. House News withdraws endorsement of Tracey Mann for 'birther' views|date=July 21, 2010|work=The Hutchinson News}}</ref> Mann responded that he was "disappointed and mystified by the ''Hutchinson News''{{'}} decision to withdraw their endorsement over a misunderstanding of [his] position", as he is not "interested in pursuing this issue in Congress", and he has "never had any interest in spending any time on the matter".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/07/kansas_congressional_candidate.html|title=Kansas Congressional Candidate Just Can’t Stop Accidentally Being a Birther|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=July 23, 2010}}</ref> Mann was subsequently defeated in the Republican primary by state senator [[Tim Huelskamp]].<ref>Clarkin, Mary (August 27, 2010), [http://www.hutchnews.com/Todaystop/huelskampwin "Republican from Fowler takes 1st Congressional District primary"], ''The Hutchinson News''</ref>

An overwhelming majority of Democrats (93%) and independents (83%) believed that he was born in the U.S. Support for the belief that Obama was born outside the U.S. was strongest in the South, where only 47% of those polled believed he was born in the U.S., compared with an average of 90% of residents of the Northeast, Midwest and West.<ref name="Thrush-poll">{{Cite news|last=Thrush|first=Glenn|work=Politico.com|title=58 percent of GOP not sure/doubt Obama born in US|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/glennthrush/0709/58_of_GOP_not_suredont_beleive_Obama_born_in_US.html|date=July 30, 2009|accessdate=July 30, 2009}}</ref> A marked racial disparity in the South was also apparent.

In [[Utah]], an August 2009 poll carried out for the ''[[Deseret News]]'' and [[KSL-TV]] found that 67% of Utahns accepted the evidence that Obama was born in the U.S. The poll found that those who do not believe that Obama was born in the United States, or do not know, are predominantly middle-aged, lower-income Republican-leaning individuals without a college education.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Bernick Jr.|first=Bob|title=Some Utahns still doubt Obama birth stats

A [[Pew Research Center]] poll found that 80% of Americans had heard about the Obama citizenship claims by August 2009. The poll found a significant partisan divide in views of the news coverage, with 58% of Democrats saying that the allegations had received too much attention from the media. Republicans were more inclined to say that the allegations had received too little attention, with 39% expressing this view against only 26% saying that the controversy had received too much attention.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://people-press.org/report/533/many-fault-media-coverage-of-health-care|date=August 6, 2009|title=Many Fault Media Coverage of Health Care Debate|publisher=The Pew Research Center for the People & the Press|accessdate=April 19, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100508214118/http://people-press.org/report/533/many-fault-media-coverage-of-health-care|archivedate=May 08 2010 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref>

===Dilemma for Republicans===
Because a significant portion of Republican voters and/or their [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] supporters believe Obama is not eligible to hold public office (see [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories#Opinion surveys|Opinion surveys section]]), Republicans sometimes found themselves caught in a dilemma between losing support or damaging their credibility.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/birther-boom/|title='Birther' Boom|work=The New York Times|first=Eric|last=Etheridge|date=July 22, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/40644.html|title=41% of Republicans: President Obama foreign-born|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|first=Andy|last=Barr|date=August 4, 2010}}</ref> They had "to walk the fine line of humoring conspiracy-minded supporters without explicitly questioning Obama's legitimacy..."<ref name=Buck>{{Cite news|title=Senate Tea-Party Candidate Accidentally Reveals What He Thinks of Birthers|date=July 26, 2010|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/07/gop_senate_candidate_getting_t.html|first=Dan|last=Amira|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]}}</ref> Other Republicans, including former Minnesota governor [[Tim Pawlenty]] and former Pennsylvania senator [[Rick Santorum]], however, have plainly rejected these claims.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/potential-gop-candidates-face-birther-question/2011/03/16/ABnx1Em_story.html|title=Potential GOP candidates face ‘birther’ question|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|first=Nia-Malika|last=Henderson|date=March 17, 2011}}</ref>

An example of these situations is [[Mike Castle]], then Representative for [[Delaware]], who ran in 2010 for the Senate seat vacated by Vice President [[Joe Biden]].

Proponents of claims doubting Obama's eligibility have been dubbed "birthers" by their critics, who have drawn a parallel with [[9/11 Truth Movement|9/11 conspiracy theorists]] or "truthers".

A number of conservative commentators including Malkin have criticized its proponents and their effect on the wider conservative movement. In late 2008, Malkin said a "dangerously large segment" of "birth certificate hunters" had "lurched into rabid Truther territory".

In November 2008, commentator and social critic [[Camille Paglia]] criticized the "blathering, fanatical overkill" of the topic, but also questioned Obama's response: "Obama could have ended the entire matter months ago by publicly requesting Hawaii to issue a fresh, long-form, stamped certificate and inviting a few high-profile reporters in to examine the document and photograph it", she said.<ref name="surfs">Paglia, Camille (November 12, 2008).

Writing in December 2008, Alex Koppelman discussed the validity of the common argument&nbsp;– that Obama should release a copy of his full, original certificate and the rumors and doubts would disappear.<ref name="Alex"/> Conspiracy theory experts told Koppelman that when committed conspiracists are presented with more data debunking their theory, they refuse to accept the new evidence. "Whatever can't be ignored can be twisted to fit into the narrative; every new disclosure of something that should, by rights, end the controversy only opens up new questions, identifies new plotters", he wrote.<ref name="Alex"/> Because Obama's release of the short-form had only "stoked the fever of conspiracy mongers", Koppleman predicted that releasing the long-form certificate "would almost certainly" continue the rumor cycle.<ref name="Alex"/>

Obama is not the first President to be the subject of controversy surrounding the location of his birth. [[Andrew Jackson]] was the subject of similar claims, although it is not certain that they were raised during his presidency. [[Chester A. Arthur]] was also claimed to have been born outside the United States, with his birth records later allegedly falsified to show he was born in Vermont.<ref>Karabell, Zachary, ''Chester Alan Arthur''.

==Impact on the 2012 Presidential election==
In May 2012, the Arizona Secretary of State, [[Ken Bennett]], asked Hawaii to verify Obama's Hawaiian birth to ensure his eligibility to appear on the November ballot.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/politics/articles/2012/05/22/20120522obama-birth-hawaii-arizona-verification.html|title=Hawaii sends Arizona verification of Obama's birth|first=Yvonne Wingett|last=Sanchez|date=May 22, 2012|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]}}</ref> After Bennett proved that he needed the information as part of the regular course of official business, Hawaii officially confirmed that the information in the copy of the Certificate of Live Birth for the President matches the original record in their files.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/05/24/arizona-birther-renaissance-sparked-by-sheriff-arpaio-secretary-of-state-bennett.html|title=Arizona Birther Renaissance Sparked By Sheriff Arpaio, Secretary of State Bennett|date=May 24, 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Beast]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/hawaii-verifies-president-obama-birth-records-arizona-elections-chief-ken-bennett-article-1.1083039|title=Hawaii verifies President Obama’s birth records to Arizona’s elections chief Ken Bennett|date=May 23, 2012|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> Later the same month, the Mississippi state Democratic Party requested Hawaii to verify that the long-form image on the White House website matched the copy on file and they were provided with a certified verification, bearing the state seal and signed by state registrar [[Alvin T.

In September 2012, the State Objections Board of Kansas, composed of "three of the state's top elected Republicans", delayed acting on a petition to remove Barack Obama's name from the ballot, requesting information from Hawaii regarding his birth certificate;<ref>{{Cite news|title=Kansas panel delays ballot decision on Obama|url=http://cjonline.com/news/2012-09-13/kansas-panel-delays-ballot-decision-obama|first=Tim|last=Carpenter|date=September 13, 2012|publisher=Topeka Capital Journal}}</ref> but later voted unanimously to accept Obama's citizenship and retain him on the state's ballot, despite objections from the floor by Orly Taitz.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/17/kansas-birther-hearing-obama-orly-taitz_n_1890446.html Celock, John.

In December 2012, 3 out of the 11 [[Electoral College (United States)|electors]] from Arizona who cast their votes for [[Mitt Romney]], raised doubts about Barack Obama's birthplace. One of those electors was the chair of the [[Republican Party of Arizona]], Tom Morrissey. Morrissey later insisted that he is not a birther, but stated that "In [his] opinion, what [he has] seen from the president, produced as a birth certificate, does not convince [him] that it is a real document."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2012/12/arizona_gop_chairman_tom_morri.php|title=Arizona GOP Chairman Tom Morrissey Says He's Not a "Birther," but Obama's Birth Certificate Doesn't Seem Real|date=Dec. 18 2012|first=Matthew|last=Hendley}}</ref> Arizona Governor [[Jan Brewer]] did not agree with the electors who expressed support for the conspiracy theories.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.knau.org/post/az-electoral-college-delegates-voted-today|date=Dec 17, 2012|title=AZ Electoral College Delegates Voted Today|first=Howard|last=Fischer|publisher=[[KNAU]], a radio station in [[Flagstaff, Arizona]]}}</ref>

==White House responses==
A common claim among those arguing that President Obama was not born in Hawaii is that all doubt would be settled if Obama released his "long form" birth certificate. However, commentators noted that doing so would be disadvantageous to Obama. First, it would encourage speculation as to why it took so long to release the document. Second, caving in to his political adversaries' demands would embolden them by giving them a victory. Finally, it would open the door to demands for other personal records unrelated to his birth certificate.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/08/05/birther_faq/|title=Salon's handy-dandy guide to refuting the Birthers|date=August 5, 2009|accessdate=August 5, 2009|last=Koppelman|first=Alex|work=[[Salon.com]]|quote=Myth #8|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090809023256/http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/08/05/birther_faq/|archivedate=August 09 2009 <!--DASHBot-->|deadurl=no}}</ref> Despite these concerns, both Obama and his press secretary have responded to reporters' questions about the issue.

===Press secretary's response===
At the end of the May 27, 2009, [[news conference|press briefing]], ''WorldNetDaily'' reporter [[Lester Kinsolving]] asked about Obama's birth certificate. [[White House press secretary]] [[Robert Gibbs]] replied, "It's on the Internet", to which Kinsolving responded "No, no, no&nbsp;– the long form listing his hospital and physician." Gibbs responded as follows:

{{quote|Lester, this question in many ways continues to astound me. The state of Hawaii provided a copy with the seal of the President's birth. I know there are apparently at least 400,000 people (laughter) that continue to doubt the existence of and the certification by the state of Hawaii of the President's birth there, but it's on the Internet because we put it on the Internet for each of those 400,000 to download.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Briefing-by-White-House-Press-Secretary-Robert-Gibbs-5/27/2009/ Official transcript of the May 27, 2009, WhiteHouse press briefing].</ref>}}

At a July 27, 2009, press briefing, radio talk show host [[Bill Press]] asked Gibbs if there was anything he could say to make the issue go away. Gibbs answered, "No. I mean, the God's honest truth is no," because "nothing will assuage" those who continue to pursue what he called "made-up, fictional nonsense" despite the evidence that Obama had already provided.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/Briefing-by-White-House-Press-Secretary-Robert-Gibbs-7-27-09/ Press briefing by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs], ''www.whitehouse.gov'' (July 27, 2009).

On August 6, 2009, Gibbs commented, "You couldn't sell this script in Hollywood," and summarized the contentions that he considered "totally crazy":

{{quote|A pregnant woman leaves her home to go overseas to have a child&nbsp;– who there’s not a passport for&nbsp;– so is in cahoots with someone&nbsp;... to smuggle that child, that previously doesn’t exist on a government roll somewhere back into the country and has the amazing foresight to place birth announcements in the Hawaii newspapers?

At the February 2010 [[National Prayer Breakfast]], Obama commented, "Surely you can question my policies without questioning my faith.

Williams asked Obama about the fact that a fifth of the American people do not believe that he is either American born or a Christian. Obama responded that "there is a mechanism, a network of misinformation that in a new media era can get churned out there constantly". He then added "I can't spend all my time with my birth certificate plastered on my forehead."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/41575.html|title=President Obama blasts lies, disinformation|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]|first=Glenn|last=Thrush|date=August 29, 2010}}</ref>

On a few occasions, Obama has joked about the conspiracy theories surrounding his birth certificate and citizenship. At the 2010 [[White House Correspondents' Association|White House Correspondents' Dinner]], Obama said there are few things in life harder to find and more important to keep than love, and then added, "Well, love and a birth certificate."<ref>{{Cite news|title=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/01/2010-white-house-correspo_n_559901.html|title=Obama Kills At White House Correspondents Dinner|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=May 1, 2010}}</ref> At the 2011 [[Gridiron Dinner]], Obama referred to [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s song, "[[Born in the U.S.A.

Two years into my presidency, some are still bent on peddling rumors about my origins. So today, I want to put all those rumors to rest. It is true my great-great-great-grandfather really was from Ireland. It’s true. [[Moneygall]], to be precise.

In an April 2011 interview with [[George Stephanopoulos]], Obama said, "I think that over the last two and a half years there's been an effort to go at me in a way that is politically expedient in the short-term for Republicans, but creates, I think a problem for them when they want to actually run in a general election where most people feel pretty confident the President was born where he says he was, in Hawaii. He doesn't have horns. We may disagree with him on some issues and we may wish that you know, the unemployment rate was coming down faster and we want him to know his plan on gas prices. But we're not really worrying about conspiracy theories or ... birth certificates. And so ... I think it presents a problem for them."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Obama: Donald Trump's birth certificate talk helps me|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-obama-trump-birth-20110415,0,5233740.story?track=rss|work=Los Angeles Times|first=James|last=Oliphant|date=April 15, 2011}}</ref>

On April 27, 2011, referring to "sideshows and carnival barkers",<ref name="MSNBCStatement"/> Obama appeared in the White House press room an hour after the release of the long form and said, "I know there is going to be a segment of people for which no matter what we put out this issue will not be put to rest. But I am speaking to the vast majority of the American people, as well as to the press. We do not have time for this kind of silliness.

Later in 2011, [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012|Obama's re-election campaign]] offered for sale mugs with a picture of Obama (captioned "Made in the USA") and the image of the birth certificate. The campaign states, "There's really no way to make the conspiracy about President Obama's birth certificate completely go away, so we might as well laugh at it&nbsp;– and make sure as many people as possible are in on the joke."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Made In The USA Mug|publisher=Obama for America|url=http://store.barackobama.com/made-in-the-usa-mug.html|accessdate=September 4, 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110723002253/http://store.barackobama.com/made-in-the-usa-mug.html|archivedate=2011-07-23}}</ref>
