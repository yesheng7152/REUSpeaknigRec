During [[Barack Obama]]'s campaign for president and in the years following his election, many [[conspiracy theories]] have been circulated, asserting that he is not a [[Natural-born-citizen clause of the U.S. Constitution|natural-born citizen of the United States]] and consequently, under [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article Two of the U.S. Constitution]], is ineligible to be President of the United States.

Theories allege that Obama's published [[birth certificate]] is a forgery—that his actual birthplace is not Hawaii but [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]]. Other theories allege that Obama became a citizen of [[Indonesia]] in childhood, thereby losing his U.S. citizenship. Still others claim that Obama is not a natural-born U.S. citizen because he was born a [[multiple citizenship|dual citizen]] (British and American). Some political commentators have characterized these various claims as a [[racism|racist]] reaction to Obama's status as the first African American president of the United States.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;racism&quot;</attr><inner>{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2011/apr/27/barack-obama-obama-administration|date=April 27, 2011|first=Michael|last=Tomasky|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=July 20, 2011|title=Birthers and the persistence of racial paranoia}}

Frequent arguments of those questioning Obama's eligibility related to the fact that he did not originally release a copy of his &quot;original&quot; or &quot;long form&quot; birth certificate, but rather a &quot;short form&quot; version that did not include all of the information given on 1961 Hawaii-issued birth certificates.

An [[April Fools Day]] hoax email circulated on the Internet starting in 2009.

<h level="2" i="17">==Disputes over &quot;natural-born citizen&quot; requirements==</h>
Another theory of Obama's ineligibility is that, regardless of his place of birth, he does not meet the constitutional definition of a [[natural-born citizen]].

The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] states: &quot;All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States....&quot; According to law professor [[Gabriel J. Chin]], &quot;there is agreement that 'natural born citizens' include those made citizens by birth under the 14th Amendment.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Cite news|title=Who's really eligible to be president?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/04/20/chin.natural.born/index.html|first=Gabriel|last=Chin|publisher=CNN|date=April 21, 2011}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/obama/citizen.asp|title=Native Son|publisher=[[Snopes]]|date=October 17, 2008}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="3" i="18">===Parental citizenship===</h>
Some campaigners, such as the Tennessee-based Liberty Legal Foundation, contend that in order for a person to be a natural-born citizen within the meaning of Article II, Section 1, it is necessary that both parents be U.S. citizens at the time of that person's birth. Those who subscribe to this theory argue that since Obama's father was not a U.S. citizen, Obama could not have been a natural-born citizen, and is therefore ineligible to be President of the United States. The Liberty Legal Foundation has cited language in an 1875 voting rights case—''[[Minor v. Happersett]]''—in support of its claim that the U.S. Supreme Court has defined natural-born citizens as &quot;all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Cite news|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2011/10/28/41005.htm|title=Birthers Sue Democratic National Committee|first=Jamie|last=Ross|date=October 28, 2011|work=[[Courthouse News Service]]}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://www.libertylegalfoundation.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Federal-DNC-Complaint.pdf Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief], pp. 3, 5.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="3" i="19">===Dual citizenship===</h>
Others, including New Jersey attorney [[Donofrio v. Wells|Leo Donofrio]], have claimed that a person cannot be a natural-born citizen if he is a dual citizen at birth. Those who subscribe to this theory argue that because Obama's father held [[CUKC|citizenship of the UK and colonies]], and not U.S. citizenship, at the time Obama was born, Obama was born a dual citizen and therefore was not a natural-born citizen.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Barnes-Obama</attr></ext>

However, Kenya's constitution prohibits dual citizenship in adulthood. Obama therefore automatically lost his Kenyan citizenship on his 23rd birthday, in 1984, by failing to formally renounce any non-Kenyan citizenship and swear an oath of allegiance to Kenya.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Cite web|title=Does Barack Obama have Kenyan citizenship?|publisher=Factcheck.org|url=http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/does_barack_obama_have_kenyan_citizenship.html|first=Joe|last=Miller|date=August 29, 2008|accessdate=December 8, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081210091436/http://www.factcheck.org/askfactcheck/does_barack_obama_have_kenyan_citizenship.html|archivedate=December 10, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Although the paper apologized for the error and published a correction, the article continued to provide fuel for online rumors about Obama's eligibility for the presidency.

The controversy over Obama's citizenship and eligibility for the presidency has prompted a number of Republican state and federal legislators to propose legislation aimed at requiring future presidential candidates to release copies of their birth certificates. Some legislators also lent their support to birth certificate-related litigation against Obama, joining as co-plaintiffs.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0510/Hawaiis_birther_bill.html|title=Hawaii's 'birther bill'|last=Smith|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Smith (journalist)|date=May 13, 2010|work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="2" i="43">==White House responses==</h>
A common claim among those arguing that President Obama was not born in Hawaii is that all doubt would be settled if Obama released his &quot;long form&quot; birth certificate. However, commentators noted that doing so would be disadvantageous to Obama. First, it would encourage speculation as to why it took so long to release the document. Second, caving in to his political adversaries' demands would embolden them by giving them a victory. Finally, it would open the door to demands for other personal records unrelated to his birth certificate.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/08/05/birther_faq/|title=Salon's handy-dandy guide to refuting the Birthers|date=August 5, 2009|accessdate=August 5, 2009|last=Koppelman|first=Alex|work=[[Salon.com]]|quote=Myth #8|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090809023256/http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/08/05/birther_faq/|archivedate=August 09 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Despite these concerns, both Obama and his press secretary have responded to reporters' questions about the issue.

At the end of the May 27, 2009, [[news conference|press briefing]], ''WorldNetDaily'' reporter [[Lester Kinsolving]] asked about Obama's birth certificate. [[White House press secretary]] [[Robert Gibbs]] replied, &quot;It's on the Internet&quot;, to which Kinsolving responded &quot;No, no, no&amp;nbsp;– the long form listing his hospital and physician.&quot; Gibbs responded as follows:
