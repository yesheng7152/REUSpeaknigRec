==History==
In November 1990 Wyoming voters approved a constitutional amendment that abolished the [[Wyoming State Board of Charities and Reform]]. The institutions of the former state agency were divided and given to other agencies; the Department of Corrections, created in 1991, took responsibility of the adult correctional facilities and also absorbed the adult parole functions of the [[Wyoming Department of Probation and Parole]].<ref>"[http://doc.state.wy.us/about/index.html About the Department of Corrections]".
