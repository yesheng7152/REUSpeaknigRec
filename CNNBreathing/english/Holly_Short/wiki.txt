In [[The Artemis Fowl Files]], she notes that she eventually earns the respect of her male colleagues.

==Work and appearances in the series==

*In [[Artemis Fowl (novel)|Artemis Fowl]], Holly is abducted by 12-year-old criminal mastermind [[Artemis Fowl II]] when he uncovers evidence of fairy existence. He demands one metric ton of gold as her ransom fund. When she consents to granting Artemis' wish of restoring his mother's sanity, he releases her along with half of her ransom fund. 

*In [[Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident]], Holly is sent to detain Artemis when he is a suspect in a [[Goblin (Artemis Fowl)|goblin]] uprising. She, along with Artemis, [[Mulch Diggums]], and Commander [[Julius Root]] are informed by [[Foaly]] that [[Opal Koboi]] and [[List_of_characters_in_Artemis_Fowl#C|Briar Cudegon]] are behind the uprising. They break into Koboi Laboratories, where Cudgeon is killed and Koboi is incapacitated. After the goblins are contained, she travels to Murmansk to rescue Artemis' father, as they previously agreed.

*In [[Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code]], Artemis requests Holly's help to heal [[Domovoi Butler]] and retrieve his [[C Cube]] from American businessman [[Jon_Spiro#Jon_Spiro|Jon Spiro]]. Together with [[Mulch Diggums]], [[Juliet Butler]], and [[Foaly]] directing technological elements of the mission, they break into the [[Spiro Needle]] and retrieve the Cube. Artemis is mind wiped at the end of the mission under the directions of [[Julius Root]]. 

*In [[Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception]], Holly is with Commander [[Julius Root|Root]], a paternal figure to her, when [[Opal Koboi]] kills him. She is subsequently framed for the Commander's death and is forced to flee from fairy authorities. She later collaborates with Artemis Fowl, [[Domovoi Butler|Butler]], and Mulch Diggums to expose Koboi and prevent her plans for destroying [[Fairy (Artemis Fowl)|fairy]] civilization. At the end of the book, she resigns from the [[Lower Elements Police|LEP]].

*In [[Artemis Fowl: The Lost Colony]], Holly is working as a private detective since her resignation from the LEP, along with Mulch Diggums. Holly is informed about the [[Demon (Artemis Fowl)|demon]] race, a species of fairy that left earth and are now inhabitting an island in limbo between earth and time, and is recruited to [[Section Eight (Artemis Fowl)|Section Eight]], which monitors them. When it becomes apparent that Artemis has encountered a demon, they encounter [[Minerva Paradizo]], who has managed to obtain a demon. Artemis and Holly, along with two demons, [[List_of_characters_in_Artemis_Fowl#N|№1]] and [[List_of_characters_in_Artemis_Fowl#Q|Qwan]], are forced to go to [[Hybras]] to save demon civilization. When they arrive back at Artemis and Holly's time, they find that three years have passed in their own dimension. 

*In [[Artemis Fowl: The Time Paradox]], Artemis and Holly travel into the past to find the silky sifaka lemur, the only thing that can save [[Fowl family (Artemis Fowl)|Angeline Fowl]] from death by a fairy disease, Spelltropy. The pair are forced to outwit Artemis' younger self and Damon Kronski, president of the "Extinctionists" organization. They eventually encounter [[Opal Koboi]], who needs the silky sifaka lemur to increase her own power. Angeline is freed, but Opal disappears at the end of the book. When Artemis comes close to death, Holly kisses him, but later regrets it when he reveals that he blackmailed her in the beginning of the book, by tricking her into thinking she was the one who infected Angeline Fowl.

<!-- ==Hamburg Incident==
Holly was involved the notorious "[[Hamburg]] incident". As revealed in the graphic novel, an unrevealed fairy fled to the surface and attempted to bargain with a group of human occultists, who were using an unspecified piece of fairy equipment. The fairy ended up in the custody of the police, and the cross-species fallout from Holly's intervention resulted in 4 full memory wipes, a time-stop, and several cases of permanent insanity among the humans involved. [[Julius Root]] has held this above her head ever since. -->
