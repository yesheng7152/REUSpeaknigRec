'''Next, Inc.''' (later '''Next Computer, Inc.''' and '''Next Software, Inc.''' and stylized as '''NeXT''') was an American [[computer]] company headquartered in [[Redwood City, California]], that developed and manufactured a series of [[computer]] [[workstation]]s intended for the [[higher education]] and business markets. NeXT was founded in 1985 by [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] co-founder [[Steve Jobs]] after he resigned from Apple. NeXT introduced the first [[NeXT Computer]] in 1988, and the smaller [[NeXTstation]] in 1990. Sales of the NeXT computers were relatively limited, with estimates of about 50,000 units shipped in total. Nevertheless, its innovative [[object-oriented]] [[NeXTSTEP]] [[operating system]] and development environment were highly influential.<template><title>Citation needed</title><part><name>date</name><equals>=</equals><value>October 2011</value></part></template>

NeXT later released much of the NeXTstep system as a [[Application programming interface|programming environment]] standard called [[OpenStep]]. NeXT withdrew from the hardware business in 1993 to concentrate on marketing [[OpenStep#OPENSTEP.2FMach|OPENSTEP]], its own OpenStep implementation, for several [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s. NeXT also developed [[WebObjects]], one of the first enterprise [[web application framework]]s. WebObjects never became very popular because of its initial high price of $50,000 but remains a prominent early example of a web server based on [[Dynamic web page|dynamic page generation]] rather than static content.

Apple purchased NeXT on December 20, 1996 for $429 million and 1.5 million shares of Apple stock,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;apple-acquisition&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite press release|title=Apple Computer, Inc.

<h level="3" i="2">===1985–1986: Founding NeXT===</h>
In 1984, Apple founder [[Steve Jobs]] was the head of Apple's SuperMicro division, which was responsible for the development of the [[Macintosh]] and [[Apple Lisa|Lisa]] personal computers. The Macintosh had been successful on university campuses in considerable part because of the [[Apple University Consortium]], which allowed students and institutions to buy the computers at a discount.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book|first=Randall|last=Stross|title=Steve Jobs and the NeXT Big Thing|publisher=Athenium|year=1993|page=56| isbn=0-689-12135-0}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Stross 1993, p. 67</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The consortium had sold more than $50 million in computers by February 1984.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite news|last=Morrison|first=Ann|title=NeXT, Microsoft tackle objects: NT to gain OpenStep port|work=Fortune|date= 1984-02-20}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

While chairman, Jobs visited university departments and faculty members to sell Macintosh. Jobs met [[Paul Berg]], a Nobel Laureate in chemistry, at a luncheon held in [[Silicon Valley]] to honour [[François Mitterrand]], then [[President of France]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;nextbigthing&quot;</attr><inner>Stross 1993, p. 72</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Cite news|last=Shannon|first=Victoria|title=Apple losing its polish in Franc| work=International Herald Tribune|page=11|date=2006-05-22|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/05/21/business/lobbyside.php }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Berg was frustrated by the expense of teaching students about [[recombinant DNA]] from textbooks instead of in [[Wet laboratory|wet labs]], used for the testing and analysis of chemicals, drugs, and other materials or biological matter. Wet labs were prohibitively expensive for lower-level courses and were too complex to be simulated on personal computers of the time. Berg suggested to Jobs to use his influence at Apple to create a &quot;[[3M computer|3M]]&quot; workstation for higher education, featuring more than one [[megabyte]] of [[random access memory]] (RAM), a [[megapixel]] display and [[megaflop]] performance (hence the name &quot;3M&quot;).

Jobs was intrigued by Berg's concept of a workstation and contemplated starting a higher education computer company in the fall of 1985, amidst increasing turmoil at Apple. Jobs' division did not release upgraded versions of the Macintosh and most of the [[Macintosh Office]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Cite news

After several months of being sidelined at Apple, Jobs resigned on Friday, September 13, 1985. He told the board he was leaving to set up a new computer company, and that he would be taking several Apple employees from the SuperMicro division with him. He also told the board that his new company would not compete with Apple and might even consider licensing its designs back to them to market under the Macintosh brand.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite news

Jobs was joined by former Apple employees [[Bud Tribble]], [[George Crow]], [[Rich Page]], [[Susan Barnes (computing)|Susan Barnes]], [[Susan Kare]], and [[Dan'l Lewin]] and named his new company Next, Inc. After consulting with major educational buyers from around the country (including a follow-up meeting with Paul Berg), a tentative specification for the workstation was drawn up.

NeXT changed its business plan in mid-1986. The company decided to develop both computer hardware and software, instead of just a low-end workstation. A team led by [[Avie Tevanian]], who had joined the company after working as one of the [[Mach (kernel)|Mach kernel]] engineers at [[Carnegie Mellon University]], was to develop the NeXTSTEP operating system. The hardware division, led by [[Rich Page]], one of the cofounders who    had previously led the [[Apple Lisa]] team, designed and developed the hardware.

Prototype workstations were shown to standing ovations on October 12, 1988. The first machines were tested in 1989, after which NeXT started selling limited numbers to universities with a [[beta testing|beta]] version of the [[NeXTSTEP]] operating system installed.

The NeXT Computer was based on the new 25&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Motorola 68030]] [[central processing unit]] (CPU).

Canon invested in NeXT with the condition that it would be able to use the NeXTSTEP environment with its own workstations, which would mean a greatly expanded market for the software.

[[Image:NeXTstation.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A [[NeXTstation]] with the original keyboard, mouse and the [[NeXT MegaPixel Display|NeXT MegaPixel]] monitor.]]
NeXT released a second generation of workstations in 1990. The new range included a revised NeXT Computer, renamed the [[NeXTcube]], and the [[NeXTstation]], nicknamed &quot;the slab,&quot; which used a &quot;[[Pizza box form factor|pizza box]]&quot; case form-factor. Jobs was explicit in ensuring NeXT staff did not use the latter terminology, lest the NeXT machines be compared to competing Sun workstations. The magneto-optical drive was replaced with a 2.88 MB floppy drive to offer users a way to use their floppy disks. However, individual 2.88 MB floppies were expensive and the technology did not supplant the 1.44 MB floppy. Realizing this, NeXT utilized the [[CD-ROM]] drive, which eventually became an industry standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and the [[NeXTdimension]] [[Video card|graphics processor]] hardware for the NeXTcube. The new computers were cheaper and faster than their predecessors, with the new [[Motorola 68040]] processor.

In 1992, NeXT launched &quot;Turbo&quot; variants of the NeXTcube and NeXTstation with a 33&amp;nbsp;MHz 68040 processor and maximum RAM capacity increased to 128 MB. NeXT sold 20,000 computers in 1992 (NeXT counted upgraded motherboards on back order as sales) – a small number compared with their competitors. However, the company reported sales of $140 million for the year, encouraging Canon to invest a further $30 million to keep the company afloat.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book | first=Jeffrey S. | last=Young | coauthors=Simon, William L. | title=iCon: Steve Jobs | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | year=2005 | page= 200 | isbn=0-471-72083-6}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

In the early 1990s [[John D Carmack|John Carmack]] used a NeXTcube to build two of his pioneering games, ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' and ''[[Making of Doom#Programming|Doom]]''. Other commercial programs were released for NeXT computers, including the [[Lotus Improv]] [[spreadsheet]] program and [[Mathematica]]. The systems also came with a number of smaller built-in applications such as the [[Merriam-Webster]] Collegiate Dictionary, [[Oxford University Press|Oxford]] Quotations, the complete works of [[William Shakespeare]], and the ''Digital Librarian'' search engine to access them.

NeXT started [[porting]] the NeXTSTEP operating system to [[PC compatible]] computers using the [[Intel 486]] processor in 1992. The operating system was ported to Intel's architecture because of a change in NeXT's business strategy. By late 1993 this port was complete and version 3.1, also known as NeXTSTEP 486, was released. Prior to the release of NeXTSTEP, [[Chrysler]] planned to buy 3,000 copies in 1992.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite news | title=Next Computer Close To a Deal With Chrysler | date=September 8, 1992 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> NeXTSTEP 3.x was later ported to [[PA-RISC family|PA-RISC]]<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;RISC&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite news | last =Sherman | first =Lee | title =First NeXT RISC Workstation | work =NeXTWORLD | year =2004 | url =http://www.simson.net/ref/NeXT/nextworld/94.4/94.4.Apr.PA-RISC1.html | accessdate=2008-04-14}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> and [[SPARC]]-based platforms, for a total of four versions: NeXTSTEP/NeXT (for NeXT's 68k &quot;black boxes&quot;), NeXTSTEP/Intel, NeXTSTEP/PA-RISC and NeXTSTEP/SPARC.

After dropping the hardware business, NeXT returned to selling a toolkit to run on other operating systems, in effect returning to the original business plan. New products based on OpenStep were released, including OpenStep Enterprise, a version for Microsoft's [[Windows NT]].

Several NeXT executives replaced their Apple counterparts when Steve Jobs restructured the company board of directors. Over the next five years the NeXTSTEP operating system was ported to the [[PowerPC]] architecture. At the same time, an Intel port and OpenStep Enterprise toolkit for Windows were both produced.
