'''Teledildonics''' (also known as "cyberdildonics") are electronic [[sex toy]]s that can be controlled by a computer.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,997256,00.html Stein, Joel, "Will cybersex be better than real sex?" Time magazine, June 19, 2000. Retrieved July 23, 2008]</ref> Promoters of these devices have claimed since the 1980s they are the "next big thing" in [[cybersex]] technology.<ref>[http://dir.salon.com/story/mwt/feature/2005/08/29/teledildonics/index.html] Grossman, Anna Jane, "Single, white with dildo." Salon, July 23, 2008. Retrieved July 23, 2008</ref> "Teledildonics" can also refer to the integration of [[telepresence]] with [[sexual intercourse|sex]] that these toys make possible &mdash; the term was [[neologism|coined]] in 1975 by [[Ted Nelson]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperland.com/TNvita.html|title=Curriculum Vitae: Theodor Holm Nelson|last=Nelson|first=Ted|accessdate=2008-03-27}}</ref> in his ''Computer Lib/Dream Machines''.

In its original conception, this technology was to have been used for remote sex (or, at least, remote [[mutual masturbation]]), where the physical sensations of [[tactition|touch]] could be transmitted over a data link between the participants.

Sex toys that can be manipulated remotely by another party are currently coming onto the market.<ref>[http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/commentary/sexdrive/2004/09/65064] Lynn, Regina, "Ins and outs of teledildonics." Wired, September 24, 2004. Retrieved July 22, 2008</ref> These toys sometimes come with prerecorded movies to which the toys' actions are synchronized by means of a previously-written script. Other products being released fit a new category called bluedildonics, which allow a sex toy to be controlled remotely via a [[Bluetooth]] connection.
