In its original conception, this technology was to have been used for remote sex (or, at least, remote [[mutual masturbation]]), where the physical sensations of [[tactition|touch]] could be transmitted over a data link between the participants.

Sex toys that can be manipulated remotely by another party are currently coming onto the market.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/commentary/sexdrive/2004/09/65064] Lynn, Regina, &quot;Ins and outs of teledildonics.&quot; Wired, September 24, 2004. Retrieved July 22, 2008</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> These toys sometimes come with prerecorded movies to which the toys' actions are synchronized by means of a previously-written script. Other products being released fit a new category called bluedildonics, which allow a sex toy to be controlled remotely via a [[Bluetooth]] connection.
