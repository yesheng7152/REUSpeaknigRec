'''Victoria''' (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819<template><title>spaced ndash</title></template>22 January 1901) was the monarch of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] from 20 June 1837 until her death. From 1 May 1876, she used the additional title of [[Emperor of India|Empress of India]].

Victoria was the daughter of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]], the fourth son of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. Both the Duke of Kent and King George III died in 1820, and Victoria was raised under close supervision by her German-born mother [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]]. She inherited the throne at the age of 18, after her father's three elder brothers had all died, leaving no legitimate, surviving children. The United Kingdom was already an established [[constitutional monarchy]], in which the sovereign held relatively little direct political power. Privately, Victoria attempted to influence government policy and ministerial appointments. Publicly, she became a national icon, and was identified with strict standards of personal morality.

Victoria married her first cousin, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], in 1840. Their [[#Issue|nine children]] married into royal and noble families across the continent, tying them together and earning her the nickname &quot;the grandmother of Europe&quot;. After Albert's death in 1861, Victoria plunged into deep mourning and avoided public appearances. As a result of her seclusion, [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republicanism]] temporarily gained strength, but in the latter half of her reign, her popularity recovered. Her [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria|Golden]] and Diamond Jubilees were times of public celebration.

Her reign of 63 years and seven months, which is [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|longer than that of any other British monarch]] and the [[List of longest-reigning monarchs|longest of any female monarch in history]], is known as the [[Victorian era]]. It was a period of industrial, cultural, political, scientific, and military change within the United Kingdom, and was marked by a great expansion of the [[British Empire]]. She was the last [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] of the [[House of Hanover]]. Her son and successor, [[Edward VII]], belonged to the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], the line of his father.

Victoria's father was [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]], the fourth son of the reigning King of the United Kingdom, [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. Until 1817, Edward's niece, [[Princess Charlotte of Wales]], was  the only legitimate grandchild of George III. Her death in 1817 precipitated a succession crisis in the United Kingdom that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children. In 1818, he married [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]], a widowed German princess who already had two children—[[Carl, 3rd Prince of Leiningen|Carl]] (1804–1856) and [[Princess Feodora of Leiningen|Feodora]] (1807–1872)—by her first marriage to the [[Emich Carl, 2nd Prince of Leiningen|Prince of Leiningen]]. Her brother [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold]] was the widower of Princess Charlotte. The Duke and Duchess of Kent's only child, Victoria, was born at 4.15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 24 May 1819 at [[Kensington Palace]] in London.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Hibbert, pp. 3–12; Strachey, pp. 1–17; Woodham-Smith, pp. 15–29</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Victoria was christened privately by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Charles Manners-Sutton]], on 24 June 1819 in the Cupola Room at Kensington Palace.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Her godparents were Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]] (represented by her uncle the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]]), her uncle the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]], her aunt [[Charlotte, Princess Royal|Queen Charlotte of Württemberg]] (represented by Victoria's aunt [[Princess Augusta Sophia of the United Kingdom|Princess Augusta]]) and Victoria's maternal grandmother the [[Countess Augusta of Reuss-Ebersdorf|Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld]] (represented by Victoria's aunt [[Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh]]).</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> She was baptised ''Alexandrina'', after one of her godparents, Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia]], and ''Victoria'' after her mother. Additional names proposed by her parents—Georgina (or Georgiana), Charlotte and Augusta—were dropped on the instructions of the Duke's elder brother, the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] (later George IV).<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Hibbert, pp. 12–13; Longford, p. 23; Woodham-Smith, pp. 34–35</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

At birth, Victoria was fifth in the line of succession after her father and his three older brothers: the Prince Regent, the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]], and the [[William IV of the United Kingdom|Duke of Clarence]] (later William IV).<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Longford, p. 24</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The Prince Regent and the Duke of York were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children. The Dukes of Kent and Clarence married on the same day 12 months before Victoria's birth, but both of Clarence's daughters (born in 1819 and 1820 respectively) died as infants. Victoria's grandfather and father died in 1820, within a week of each other, and the Duke of York died in 1827. On the death of her uncle George IV in 1830, Victoria became [[heir presumptive|heiress presumptive]] to her next surviving uncle, William IV. The [[Regency Act 1830]] made special provision for the Duchess of Kent to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Hibbert, p. 31; St Aubyn, p. 26; Woodham-Smith, p. 81</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> King William distrusted the Duchess's capacity to be regent, and in 1836 declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria's 18th birthday, so that a [[regency]] could be avoided.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Hibbert, p. 46; Longford, p. 54; St Aubyn, p. 50; Waller, p. 344; Woodham-Smith, p. 126</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

In 1830, the Duchess of Kent and Conroy took Victoria across the centre of England to visit the [[Malvern Hills]], stopping at towns and great [[country house]]s along the way.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Hibbert, pp. 34–35</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Similar journeys to other parts of England and Wales were taken in 1832, 1833, 1834 and 1835.

By 1836, the Duchess's brother, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold]], who had been King of the Belgians since 1831, hoped to marry his niece to his nephew, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Longford, pp. 29, 51; Waller, p. 363; Weintraub, pp. 43–49</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Leopold, Victoria's mother, and Albert's father ([[Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]) were siblings.

Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837, and a regency was avoided.

Since 1714, Britain had shared a monarch with [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] in Germany, but under [[Salic law]] women were excluded from the Hanoverian succession. While Victoria inherited all the British dominions, Hanover passed instead to her father's younger brother, her unpopular uncle the Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale, who became King [[Ernest Augustus I of Hanover]].

On 29 May 1842, Victoria was riding in a carriage along [[The Mall, London]], when John Francis aimed a pistol at her but the gun did not fire; he escaped. The following day, Victoria drove the same route, though faster and with a greater escort, in a deliberate attempt to provoke Francis to take a second aim and catch him in the act. As expected, Francis shot at her, but he was seized by plain clothes policemen, and convicted of high treason.

Melbourne's support in the House of Commons weakened through the early years of Victoria's reign, and in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1841|1841 general election]] the Whigs were defeated.

On 23 September 1896, Victoria surpassed her grandfather [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] as the [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|longest-reigning monarch in English, Scottish, and British history]]. The Queen requested that any special celebrations be delayed until 1897, to coincide with her [[Diamond Jubilee]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Hibbert, p. 456</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> which was made a festival of the [[British Empire]] at the suggestion of [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] [[Joseph Chamberlain]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Longford, p. 546; St Aubyn, pp. 545–546</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

The prime ministers of all the self-governing [[dominion]]s were invited, and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee procession through London included troops from all over the empire. The parade paused for an open-air service of thanksgiving held outside [[St Paul's Cathedral]], throughout which Victoria sat in her open carriage. The celebration was marked by great outpourings of affection for the [[septuagenarian]] Queen.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Hibbert, pp. 457–458; Marshall, pp. 206–207, 211; St Aubyn, pp. 546–548</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Victoria visited mainland Europe regularly for holidays.

As Sovereign, Victoria used the [[royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]]. Before her accession, she received no grant of arms. As she could not succeed to the throne of Hanover, her arms did not carry the Hanoverian symbols that were used by her immediate predecessors. Her arms have been borne by all of her successors on the throne, including the present Queen.

Outside Scotland, the [[blazon]] for the shield—also used on the [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom|Royal Standard]]—is: [[Quartering (heraldry)|Quarterly]]: I and IV, [[Gules]], three [[Lion (heraldry)|lions]] [[Attitude (heraldry)#Passant|passant guardant]] in [[Pale (heraldry)|pale]] [[Or (heraldry)|Or]] ([[Royal Arms of England|for England]]); II, Or, a lion [[rampant]] within a double [[tressure]] flory-counter-flory Gules ([[Royal coat of arms of Scotland|for Scotland]]); III, [[Azure (heraldry)|Azure]], a harp Or stringed [[Argent]] ([[Coat of arms of Ireland|for Ireland]]). In Scotland, the first and fourth quarters are occupied by the Scottish lion, and the second by the English lions.
