His ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', published in 1687, is considered to be the most influential book in the [[history of science]].  In this work, Newton described [[law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]] and the three [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]], laying the groundwork for [[classical mechanics]], which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries and is the basis for modern engineering.  Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of [[celestial mechanics|celestial]] bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws by demonstrating the consistency between [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] and his theory of gravitation, thus removing the last doubts about [[heliocentrism]] and advancing the [[scientific revolution]].

In mechanics, Newton enunciated the principles of [[Momentum|conservation of momentum]] and [[angular momentum]]. In [[optics]], he invented the [[reflecting telescope]] and developed a theory of [[colour]] based on the observation that a [[triangular prism (optics)|prism]] decomposes [[white]] [[light]] into a [[visible spectrum]].  He also formulated an empirical [[Newton's law of cooling|law of cooling]] and studied the [[speed of sound]].

In mathematics, Newton shares the credit with [[Gottfried Leibniz]] for the [[history of calculus|development]] of [[calculus]]. He also demonstrated the [[binomial theorem|generalized binomial theorem]], developed the so-called &quot;[[Newton's method]]&quot; for approximating the zeroes of a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], and contributed to the study of [[power series]].

In a 2005 poll of the [[Royal Society]] asking who had the greater effect on the [[history of science]], Newton was deemed much more influential than [[Albert Einstein]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web |title=Newton beats Einstein in polls of scientists and the public |work=The Royal Society |url=http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/news.asp?id=3880 |accessdate=2006-10-25}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

[[Image:Isaac Newton.jpeg|thumb|left|200px|Newton in a 1702 portrait by [[Godfrey Kneller]].]] Isaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643 &lt;small&gt;<ext><name>nowiki</name><attr/><inner>[</inner><close>&lt;/nowiki&gt;</close></ext>[[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]]: [[25 December]] [[1642]]<ext><name>nowiki</name><attr/><inner>]</inner><close>&lt;/nowiki&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;OSNS&quot;</attr></ext>&lt;/small&gt; at [[Woolsthorpe Manor]] in [[Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth]], a [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]] in the county of [[Lincolnshire]]. At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted the [[Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Europe|latest papal calendar]] and therefore his date of birth was recorded as Christmas Day, [[25 December]] [[1642]]. Newton was born three months after the death of his father. Born [[Premature birth|prematurely]], he was a small child; his mother [[Hannah Ayscough]] reportedly said that he could have fit inside a [[quart]] [[mug]]. When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabus Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. The young Isaac disliked his stepfather and held some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19:  ''Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them.''<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Cohen, I.B. (1970). Dictionary of Scientific Biography, Vol. 11, p.43. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  

According to [[Eric Temple Bell|E.T. Bell]] and H. Eves:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Newton began his schooling in the village schools and was later sent to [[The King's School, Grantham]], where he became the top student in the school. At King's, he lodged with the local [[apothecary]], [[William Clarke (apothecary)|William Clarke]] and eventually became engaged to the apothecary's stepdaughter, Anne Storer, before he went off to the [[University of Cambridge]] at the age of 19. As Newton became engrossed in his studies, the romance cooled and Miss Storer married someone else. It is said he kept a warm memory of this love, but Newton had no other recorded &quot;sweet-hearts&quot; and never married.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book |last=Bell |first=E.T. |origyear=1937 |year=1986 |title=Men of Mathematics |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |edition=Touchstone edition |pages=pp. 91–2}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

There are rumours that he remained a virgin.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://www.ams.org/notices/200311/rev-krantz.pdf Book Review Isaac Newton biography] December 2003</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> However, Bell and Eves' sources for this claim, William Stukeley and Mrs. Vincent (the former Miss Storer &amp;mdash; actually named Katherine, not Anne), merely say that Newton entertained &quot;a passion&quot; for Storer while he lodged at the Clarke house.

From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at [[The King's School, Grantham]] (where his signature can still be seen upon a library window sill). He was removed from school, and by October 1659, he was to be found at [[Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth]], where his mother, widowed by now for a second time, attempted to make a farmer of him. He was, by later reports of his contemporaries, thoroughly unhappy with the work. It appears to have been Henry Stokes, master at the King's School, who persuaded his mother to send him back to school so that he might complete his education. This he did at the age of eighteen, achieving an admirable final report.

In June 1661, he was admitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. According to [[John Stillwell]], he entered Trinity as a [[sizar]]<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book

At that time, the college's teachings were based on those of [[Aristotle]], but Newton preferred to read the more advanced ideas of modern philosophers such as [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[astronomers]] such as [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], and [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. In 1665, he discovered the generalized binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that would later become [[calculus]]. Soon after Newton had obtained his degree in August of 1665, the University closed down as a precaution against the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague]]. Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>ed. Michael Hoskins (1997). Cambridge Illustrated History of Astronomy, p.&amp;nbsp;159. Cambridge University Press</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Newton's private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the subsequent two years saw the development of his theories on calculus, [[optics]] and the [[law of gravitation]].

<h level="4" i="4">====Mathematics====</h>
Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz had developed calculus independently, using their own unique notations. According to Newton's inner circle, Newton had worked out his method years before Leibniz, yet he published almost nothing about it until [[1693 in science|1693]], and did not give a full account until [[1704 in science|1704]]. Meanwhile, Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in [[1684 in science|1684]]. Moreover, Leibniz's notation and &quot;differential Method&quot; were universally adopted on the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], and after [[1820 in science|1820]] or so, in the [[British Empire]]. Whereas Leibniz's notebooks show the advancement of the ideas from early stages until maturity, there is only the end product in Newton's known notes. Newton claimed that he had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared being mocked for it<comment>&lt;!-- request citation --&gt;</comment>. Newton had a very close relationship with Swiss mathematician [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]], who from the beginning was impressed by Newton's [[gravitational theory]]. In [[1691 in science|1691]] Duillier planned to prepare a new version of Newton's ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', but never finished it. Some of Newton's biographers have suggested that the relationship may have been romantic.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://www.knittingcircle.org.uk/isaacnewton.html Biography of Isaac Newton] at [http://www.knittingcircle.org.uk www.knittingcircle.org.uk]</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  However, in [[1694 in science|1694]] the relationship between the two men cooled down. At the time, Duillier had also exchanged several letters with Leibniz.

Starting in [[1699 in science|1699]], other members of the [[Royal Society]] (of which Newton was a member) accused Leibniz of [[plagiarism]], and the dispute broke out in full force in [[1711 in science|1711]]. Newton's Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labeled Leibniz a fraud. This study was cast into doubt when it was later found that Newton himself wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter [[Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy]], which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in [[1716 in science|1716]]. 

Newton is generally credited with the [[Binomial theorem#Newton.27s generalized binomial theorem|generalized binomial theorem]], valid for any exponent. He discovered [[Newton's identities]], [[Newton's method]], classified cubic plane curves ([[polynomials]] of degree three in two [[variables]]), made substantial contributions to the theory of [[finite differences]], and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ [[coordinate geometry]] to derive solutions to [[Diophantine equations]]. He approximated partial sums of the [[Harmonic series (mathematics)|harmonic series]] by [[logarithms]] (a precursor to [[Euler's summation formula]]), and was the first to use [[power series]] with confidence and to revert power series. He also discovered a new formula for calculating [[pi]]. 

He was elected [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] in [[1669 in science|1669]]. In that day, any fellow of Cambridge or [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] had to be an ordained [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest. However, the terms of the Lucasian professorship required that the holder ''not'' be active in the church (presumably so as to have more time for science). Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. Thus a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.

<h level="4" i="5">==== Optics ====</h>

From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During this period he investigated the [[refraction]] of light, demonstrating that a [[Triangular prism (optics)|prism]] could decompose [[White|white light]] into a [[optical spectrum|spectrum]] of colours, and that a [[Lens (optics)|lens]] and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. 
[[Image:NewtonsTelescopeReplica.jpg|thumb|right|A replica of Newton's <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>6</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>in</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>mm</value></part><part><name>sing</name><equals>=</equals><value>on</value></part></template> reflecting telescope of 1672 for the [[Royal Society]].]]
He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that regardless of whether it was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as [[Isaac Newton's early life and achievements#Newton's theory of colour|Newton's theory of colour]].

From this work he concluded that any refracting [[telescope]] would suffer from the [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] of light into colours, and invented a reflecting telescope (today known as a [[Newtonian telescope]]) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using [[Newton's rings]] to judge the [[quality]] of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the refracting telescope, due primarily to the wider diameter of the mirror. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes ''On Colour'', which he later expanded into his ''Opticks''. When [[Robert Hooke]] criticized some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. The two men remained enemies until Hooke's death.

Newton argued that light is composed of particles or ''corpuscles,'' which were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with [[wave]]s to explain the [[diffraction]] of light (''Opticks'' Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's [[quantum mechanics]], [[photons]] and the idea of [[wave-particle duality]] bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.

In his ''Hypothesis of Light'' of 1675, Newton [[wikt:posit|posit]]ed the existence of the [[luminiferous aether|ether]] to transmit forces between particles. The contact with the [[theosophist]] [[Henry More]], revived his interest in alchemy. He replaced the ether with occult forces based on [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. [[John Maynard Keynes]], who acquired many of Newton's writings on alchemy, stated that &quot;Newton was not the first of the age of reason: he was the last of the magicians.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book |last=Keynes |first=John Maynard |year=1972 |chapter=&quot;Newton, The Man&quot; |title=The Collected Writings of John Maynard Keynes Volume X |publisher=MacMillan St. Martin's Press |pages=pp. 363–4}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Newton's interest in alchemy cannot be isolated from his contributions to science.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book |last=Westfall |first=Richard S. |origyear=1980 |year=1983 |title=&quot;Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=pp. 530–1}} notes that Newton apparently abandoned his alchemical researches.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> (This was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science.) Had he not relied on the [[occult]] idea of [[action at a distance (physics)|action at a distance]], across a vacuum, he might not have developed his theory of gravity. (See also [[Isaac Newton's occult studies]].)

In 1704 Newton published ''[[Opticks]]'', in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation &quot;Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal |last=Dobbs |first=J.T. |year=1982 |month=December |title=Newton's Alchemy and His Theory of Matter |journal=Isis |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=p. 523 |doi=10.1086/353114}} quoting ''Opticks''</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  Newton also constructed a primitive form of a frictional [[electrostatic generator]], using a [[glass]] globe (Optics, 8th Query).

<template lineStart="1"><title>further</title><part><name index="1"/><value>[[Writing of Principia Mathematica]]</value></part></template>

In 1677, Newton returned to his work on mechanics, i.e., gravitation and its effect on the orbits of [[planet]]s, with reference to [[Kepler's laws]] of planetary motion, and consulting with Hooke and [[John Flamsteed|Flamsteed]] on the subject. He published his results in ''[[De motu corporum in gyrum]]'' (1684). This contained the beginnings of the laws of motion that would inform the ''Principia''.

The ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' (now known as the ''Principia'') was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from [[Edmond Halley]]. In this work Newton stated the [[Isaac Newton#Newton's laws of motion|three universal laws of motion]] that were not to be improved upon for more than two hundred years. He used the Latin word ''gravitas'' (weight) for the effect that would become known as [[gravity]], and defined the law of [[universal gravitation]]. In the same work he presented the first analytical determination, based on [[Boyle's law]], of the speed of sound in air. Newton's postulate of an invisible [[action at a distance|force able to act over vast distances]] led to him being criticized for introducing &quot;[[occult]] agencies&quot; into science.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Edelglass et al., ''Matter and Mind'', ISBN 0940262452. p. 54</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

With the ''Principia'', Newton became internationally recognized. He acquired a circle of admirers, including the [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-born mathematician [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]], with whom he formed an intense relationship that lasted until 1693. The end of this friendship led Newton to a [[nervous breakdown]].

In the 1690s Newton wrote a number of [[religious tracts]] dealing with the literal interpretation of the [[Bible]]. [[Henry More]]'s belief in the universe and rejection of [[Cartesian dualism]] may have influenced Newton's religious ideas. A manuscript he sent to [[John Locke]] in which he disputed the existence of the [[Trinity]] was never published. Later works — ''[[The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended]]'' (1728) and ''Observations Upon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John'' (1733) — were published after his death. He also devoted a great deal of time to alchemy (see above).<comment>&lt;!--old cite was (Westfall 1980, pp. 530-1) &quot;notes that Newton apparently abandoned his alchemical researches&quot;--&gt;</comment>

Newton was also a member of the [[Parliament of England]] from 1689 to 1690 and in 1701, but his only recorded comments were to complain about a cold draft in the chamber and request that the window be closed.

Newton moved to [[London]] to take up the post of warden of the [[Royal Mint]] in 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of [[Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax]], then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. He took charge of England's great recoining, somewhat treading on the toes of Master Lucas (and securing the job of deputy [[comptroller]] of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley). Newton became perhaps the best-known [[Master of the Mint]] upon Lucas' death in 1699, a position Newton held until his death.  These appointments were intended as [[sinecure]]s, but Newton took them seriously, retiring from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercising his power to reform the currency and punish [[debasement|clippers]] and counterfeiters. As Master of the Mint in 1717 Newton unofficially moved the [[Pound Sterling]] from the [[silver standard]] to the [[gold standard]] by creating a relationship between gold coins and the silver penny in the [[Anne of Great Britain|&quot;Law of Queen Anne&quot;]]; these were all great reforms at the time, adding considerably to the wealth and stability of England.  It was his work at the Mint, rather than his earlier contributions to science, that earned him a [[knighthood]] from Queen Anne in 1705.

Newton was made President of the [[Royal Society]] in 1703 and an associate of the French [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des Sciences]]. In his position at the Royal Society, Newton made an enemy of John Flamsteed, the [[Astronomer Royal]], by prematurely publishing Flamsteed's star catalogue, which Newton had used in his studies.

Newton died in London on [[31 March]] [[1727]] &lt;small&gt;<ext><name>nowiki</name><attr/><inner>[</inner><close>&lt;/nowiki&gt;</close></ext>[[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]]: [[20 March]] [[1726]]<ext><name>nowiki</name><attr/><inner>]</inner><close>&lt;/nowiki&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;OSNS&quot;</attr></ext>&lt;/small&gt;, and was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]].

Historian [[Stephen Snobelen|Stephen D. Snobelen]] says of Newton, &quot;Isaac Newton was a heretic. But like [[Nicodemus]], the secret disciple of Jesus, he never made a public declaration of his private faith - which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. He hid his faith so well that scholars are still unravelling his personal beliefs.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;heretic&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite journal |last=Snobelen |first=Stephen D. |year=1999 |title=Isaac Newton, heretic : the strategies of a Nicodemite |journal=British Journal for the History of Science |volume=32 | pages=pp. 381–419 | date =1999 | url =http://www.isaac-newton.org/heretic.pdf |doi=10.1017/S0007087499003751 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>. Snobelen concludes that Newton was at least a [[Socinian]] sympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight Socinian books), possibly an [[Arianism|Arian]] and almost certainly an [[antitrinitarian]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;heretic&quot;</attr></ext> In an age notable for its religious intolerance there are few public expressions of Newton's radical views, most notably his refusal to take holy orders and his refusal, on his death bed, to take the [[sacrament]] when it was offered to him.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;heretic&quot;</attr></ext>

Although the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton's best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. He said, &quot;Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;tiner&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book |last=Tiner |first=J.H. |year=1975 |title=Isaac Newton: Inventor, Scientist and Teacher |publisher=Mott Media |location=Milford, Michigan, U.S.}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

His scientific fame notwithstanding, Newton's studies of the Bible and of the early [[Church Fathers]] were also noteworthy.  Newton wrote works on [[textual criticism]], most notably ''[[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]]''. He also placed the crucifixion of [[Jesus Christ]] at [[3 April]], AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>John P. Meier, ''[[John P.

In his own lifetime, Newton wrote more on religion than he did on natural science. He believed in a rationally immanent world, but he rejected the [[hylozoism]] implicit in [[Leibniz]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]]. Thus, the ordered and dynamically informed [[universe]] could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason, but this universe, to be perfect and ordained, had to be regular.

Newton and [[Robert Boyle]]’s mechanical philosophy was promoted by [[rationalist]] [[pamphleteer]]s as a viable alternative to the [[pantheism|pantheists]] and [[enthusiasm|enthusiasts]], and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the [[latitudinarian]]s.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book |last=Jacob |first=Margaret C. |year=1976 |title=The Newtonians and the English Revolution: 1689–1720 |publisher=Cornell University Press |pages=pp. 37,44}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Thus, the clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] superlatives of both [[superstition|superstitious]] enthusiasm and the threat of [[atheism]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book |last=Westfall |first=Richard S. |year=1958 |title=Science and Religion in Seventeenth-Century England |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |pages=p. 200}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> and, at the same time, the second wave of English [[deism|deists]] used Newton's discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a &quot;Natural Religion.&quot;  

The attacks made against pre-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] &quot;magical thinking,&quot; and the [[Christian mysticism|mystical elements of Christianity]], were given their foundation with Boyle’s mechanical conception of the universe.

In a manuscript he wrote in 1704 in which he describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible, he estimated that the world would end no earlier than 2060. In predicting this he said, &quot;This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | title = Papers Show Isaac Newton's Religious Side, Predict Date of Apocalypse | publisher = The Associated Press | date=19 June 2007 | url = http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070619/28049_Papers_Show_Isaac_Newton%27s_Religious_Side%2C_Predict_Date_of_Apocalypse.htm| accessdate=2007-08-01}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="2" i="11">==Newton and the counterfeiters==</h>
As warden of the [[Royal Mint]], Newton estimated that 20% of the coins taken in during The [[Royal Mint|Great Recoinage]] were [[counterfeit]]. Counterfeiting was [[High treason in the United Kingdom|high treason]], punishable by being [[hung, drawn and quartered]]. Despite this, convictions of the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult to achieve; however, Newton proved to be equal to the task. 

Disguised as an habitué of bars and taverns, he gathered much of that evidence himself. For all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government, [[English law]] still had ancient and formidable customs of authority. Newton was made a [[justice of the peace]] and between June 1698 and Christmas 1699 conducted some 200 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers and suspects. Newton won his convictions and in February 1699, he had ten prisoners waiting to be executed.  

Possibly Newton's greatest triumph as the king's attorney was against William Chaloner. One of Chaloner's schemes was to set up phony conspiracies of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] and then turn in the hapless conspirators whom he entrapped. Chaloner made himself rich enough to posture as a gentleman. Petitioning Parliament, Chaloner accused the Mint of providing tools to counterfeiters (a charge also made by others). He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the Mint's processes in order to improve them. He petitioned Parliament to adopt his plans for a coinage that could not be counterfeited, while at the same time striking false coins. Newton was outraged, and went about the work to uncover anything about Chaloner. During his studies, he found that Chaloner was engaged in counterfeiting. He immediately put Chaloner on trial, but Chaloner had friends in high places and, to Newton's horror, Chaloner walked free. Newton put him on trial a second time with conclusive evidence. Chaloner was convicted of high treason and hanged, drawn and quartered on [[23 March]] [[1699]] at [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn gallows]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Westfall 1980, pp. 571–5</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="2" i="12">==Enlightenment philosophers==</h>
[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors—Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally—as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of [[Nature]] and [[Natural law|Natural Law]] to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Cassels, Alan. Ideology and International Relations in the Modern World. p2.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

It was Newton’s conception of the universe based upon Natural and rationally understandable laws that became the seed for Enlightenment [[ideology]]. Locke and [[Voltaire]] applied concepts of Natural Law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the [[physiocrat]]s and [[Adam Smith]] applied Natural conceptions of [[psychology]] and self-interest to economic systems and the [[sociology|sociologists]] criticised the current [[social order]] for trying to fit history into Natural models of [[progress (philosophy)|progress]].  [[Monboddo]] and [[Samuel Clarke]] resisted elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.

<h level="2" i="13">==Newton's laws of motion==</h>

<template lineStart="1"><title>main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Newton's laws of motion</value></part></template>
The famous three laws of motion:

''Newton's First Law'' (also known as the Law of [[Inertia]]) states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest and that an object in uniform motion tends to stay in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net external force.

''Newton's Second Law'' states that an applied force, <ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner> F </inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext>, on an object equals the rate of change of its momentum, <ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner> p </inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext>, with time. Mathematically, we may write that <ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner> \vec F = \frac{d\vec p}{dt} \, = \, \frac{d}{dt} (m \vec v) \, = \, \vec v \, \frac{dm}{dt} + m \, \frac{d\vec v}{dt} \,.</inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext>   Assuming the mass to be constant, the first term vanishes, and we may write that <ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner> \vec F = m \, \vec a \,.</inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext>, indicating that a force <ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner>F</inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext> applied to an object of mass <ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner>m</inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext> causes it to accelerate at a rate <ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner>a</inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext>, the acceleration, defined as <ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner>\vec a \ =\  d\vec v/dt </inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext>.  This equality requires a consistent set of units for measuring mass, length, and time.  One such set is the [[SI]] system, where mass is in [[kilograms]], length in [[metres]], and time in [[seconds]].  This leads to force being in [[newtons]], named in his honour, and acceleration in metres per second per second.
 
''Newton's Third Law'' states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
This leads to an apparent paradox, exemplified by a man pulling a stone along the ground with a string.  The tension in the string acts equally on the man and the stone, pulling the man back and the stone forward, to the same degree.  Thus no net force is experienced by the man/string/stone combination, and it cannot move.  The resolution depends on considering the forces acting on each body individually:  The force on the stone is more than that required to overcome friction;  so the stone moves, and, if the man does not move, the string becomes slack and the stone stops.  But when he does move, maintaining the tension in the string, then man, string, and stone move forward together.

A popular story claims that Newton was inspired to formulate his theory of universal gravitation by the fall of an apple from a tree.  Cartoons have gone further to suggest the apple actually hit Newton's head, and that its impact somehow made him aware of the force of gravity.  John Conduitt, Newton's assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton's niece, described the event when he wrote about Newton's life:

<template lineStart="1"><title>cquote</title><part><name index="1"/><value>In the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire. Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity (which brought an apple from a tree to the ground) was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought. Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself &amp; if so, that must influence her motion &amp; perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web |url= http://www.newtonproject.ic.ac.uk/texts/viewtext.php?id=THEM00167&amp;mode=diplomatic |last=Conduitt|first=John |title=Keynes Ms. 130.4:Conduitt's account of Newton's life at Cambridge|work=Newtonproject| accessdate=2006-08-30}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext></value></part></template>

The question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the moon to its orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon's orbital period, and get good agreement. He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it &quot;universal gravitation&quot;.

A contemporary writer, [[William Stukeley]], recorded in his ''Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's Life'' a conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726, in which Newton recalled &quot;when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. It was occasioned by the fall of an apple, as he sat in contemplative mood. Why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground, thought he to himself. Why should it not go sideways or upwards, but constantly to the earth's centre.&quot; In similar terms, Voltaire wrote in his ''Essay on Epic Poetry'' (1727), &quot;Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree.&quot; These accounts are probably exaggerations of Newton's own tale about sitting by a window in his home ([[Woolsthorpe Manor]]) and watching an apple fall from a tree. 

Various trees are claimed to be &quot;the&quot; apple tree which Newton describes. The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster's garden some years later, the staff of the [now] [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]-owned Woolsthorpe Manor dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton. A descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room Newton lived in when he studied there. The National Fruit Collection at Brogdale<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://www.brogdale.org.uk/nfc_home.php Brogdale - Home of the National Fruit Collection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> can supply grafts from their tree (ref 1948-729), which appears identical to [[Flower of Kent]], a coarse-fleshed cooking variety.

Historians generally think the above quote was an attack on Hooke (who was short and hunchbacked), rather than — or in addition to — a statement of modesty. The two were in a dispute over optical discoveries at the time. The latter interpretation also fits with many of his other disputes over his discoveries — such as the question of who discovered calculus as discussed above.
