'''Hurricane Dog''' was the most intense [[Atlantic hurricane|hurricane]] of the [[1950 Atlantic hurricane season]]. The fourth named storm of the season, Dog developed on August 30 to the east of [[Antigua]], and after passing through the northern [[Lesser Antilles]], it turned to the north and intensified into a [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5]] hurricane. Dog reached its peak intensity with winds of {{convert|185|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on|lk=in}} over the open Atlantic, and after weakening it passed within {{convert|200|mi|km|-1}} of [[Cape Cod]]. The storm became [[extratropical cyclone|extratropical]] on September 12.

Hurricane Dog caused extensive damage to the [[Leeward Islands]], and was considered the most severe hurricane on record in [[Antigua]]. Many buildings were destroyed or severely damaged on the island, with thousands left homeless just weeks after [[1950 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Baker|Hurricane Baker]] had caused serious damage there. In the [[United States]], the hurricane caused moderate coastal damage, including damage to several boats, and resulted in 11 offshore drownings. Strong winds caused widespread power outages across southeastern [[New England]]. Damage across its path totaled about $3&nbsp;million (1950&nbsp;USD, ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|3000000|1950|2009}}|1}} 2009&nbsp;USD).

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Dog 1950 track.png}}
Tropical Storm Dog was first observed as a {{convert|70|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} tropical storm on August 30, when the ''SS Sibrodin'' reported gale force winds and an [[low pressure area|area of low pressure]] about {{convert|320|mi|km|-1}} east-southeast of [[Antigua]]. Its origin is unknown, though it is believed to have formed from a [[tropical wave]] that left the coast of [[Africa]] on August 24. With [[ridge (meteorology)|high pressures]] to its northeast, the storm tracked west-northwestward, and attained hurricane status early on August 31. Hurricane Dog turned to the northwest on September 1, and intensified into a major hurricane that night as it passed just north of the northern [[Lesser Antilles]].<ref name="mwr">{{cite journal |author =Grady Norton | year = 1951 | month = January | title = Hurricanes of the 1950 Season | journal= Monthly Weather Review | volume =79| issue =1| pages = 11 | publisher = American Meteorological Society |issn = 0027-0644 | url = http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/079/mwr-079-01-0008.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate = 2007-11-01}}</ref> While the hurricane was passing near the islands, the island of [[Saint Martin]] reported a pressure of 978.7&nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|mbar]].<ref name="metserant">{{cite web|author=Meteorological Service of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba|year=2006|title=Hurricanes and Tropical Storms in the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba|accessdate=2007-04-01|url=http://www.weather.an/reports/documents/HurricanesandTropicalStorms.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

Under weak [[tropical cyclone#steering winds|steering current]]s, Hurricane Dog drifted northwestward as it steadily intensified, and on September 5 attained [[List of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes|Category 5 status]] about {{convert|335|mi|km|-1}} north of the eastern tip of the [[Dominican Republic]]. The hurricane strengthened further after turning to the north-northeast, and on September 6 [[Hurricane Hunters]] estimated peak winds of {{convert|185|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} about {{convert|450|mi|km}} south-southwest of [[Bermuda]]. At the time, reconnaissance practices were in their infancy, so it is possible the hurricane was over-estimated. Although the wind speed measurements may not be accurate, Dog was a formidable hurricane while over the western Atlantic, producing wave heights of over {{convert|100|ft|m|-1}}.<ref name="mwr"/>

Hurricane Dog maintained its peak intensity for about 18&nbsp;hours.<ref name="hurdat">{{cite web| author=NHC Hurricane Research Division|title=Atlantic hurricane best track|publisher=NOAA| date=[[2006-02-17]]|accessdate=2007-04-01|url=http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/hurdat/easyhurdat_5105.html}}</ref> On September 7, the cyclone attained a central pressure of {{convert|948|mbar|inHg|2|abbr=on}}, which was the lowest pressure in association with the hurricane.<ref name="WeaCirc">{{cite web|author=Winston, Jay S|year=1950|url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/078/mwr-078-09-0177.pdf|title=The Weather and Circulation of September 1950|publisher=U.S. Weather Bureau|accessdate=2008-12-28}}</ref> A building [[ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] of high pressure to its north caused it to decelerate and weaken steadily for unknown reasons as it turned to the west; by September 9, the intensity had decreased to 90&nbsp;mph (145&nbsp;km/h). On September 10, as it turned northward, Hurricane Dog briefly re-intensified slightly to winds of about {{convert|100|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} before weakening again. The hurricane passed within {{convert|200|mi|km|-1}} of [[Cape Cod]] on September 12, and shortly afterwards it transitioned to an [[extratropical cyclone]]. The extratropical remnant turned to the east and later to the northeast, and the system persisted, finally losing its identity near [[Ireland]] on September 16.<ref name="mwr"/>

==Preparations==
In the [[United States]], the threat of the hurricane prompted the [[NOAA|National Weather Bureau]] to issue warnings of gale force winds, high tides, and rough surf from the [[Outer Banks]] of [[North Carolina]] to [[Maine]]. At least 17&nbsp;naval ships were moved in preparation for the hurricane. [[Rhode Island]] state police officers warned homeowners near the coast to be ready to evacuate, if necessary. There, officials also closed several beaches and canceled ferry travel along the state's southern waterways.<ref name="ap911">{{cite news|author=Associated Press|date=1950-09-11|title=Hurricane Winds, High Tides Due Along Newport Shore Tonight|publisher=The Newport Daily News|accessdate=2007-04-01|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=5625712&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=0&currentPage=0}}</ref>
On the day of the hurricane's closest approach to the United States, the National Weather Bureau issued [[tropical cyclone warnings and watches|storm warnings]] from [[Cape May, New Jersey]] to [[Eastport, Maine]].<ref name="ls912">{{cite news|author=Lowell Sun|date=1950-09-12|title=Hurricane Misses Nantucket|accessdate=2007-04-02|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=55655483&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=0&currentPage=0}}</ref>

==Impact==
Passing through the [[Lesser Antilles]], Hurricane Dog produced a [[storm surge]] of {{convert|8|ft|m|1}} in [[Antigua]].<ref name="antiguahurric">{{cite web|author=Hurricanecity.com|year=2006|url=http://www.hurricanecity.com/city/antigua.htm|accessdate=2007-04-01|title=Antigua Hurricanes}}</ref> Winds on Antigua and [[Barbuda]] were estimated at {{convert|130|mph|km/h|-1|abbr=on}},<ref name="mwr"/> with a gust of {{convert|144|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} recorded at [[St. John's, Antigua and Barbuda]].<ref name="ins92">{{cite news|author=International News Service|date=1950-09-02|title=Second Hurricane Lashes Caribbean|publisher=The Charleston Gazette|accessdate=2007-04-01|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=40561292&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=5&currentPage=0}}</ref> On Antigua, where hurricane force winds were reported for 6&nbsp;hours, residents considered it the most severe hurricane in history.<ref name="mwr"/> Hurricane Dog left thousands homeless on Antigua, just weeks after [[Hurricane Baker (1950)|Hurricane Baker]] caused severe damage on the island.<ref name="cp92">{{cite news|author=Canadian Press|date=1950-09-02|title=Havoc Heaped On Antigua As Storm Strikes Again|publisher=Daily Gleaner|accessdate=2007-04-01|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=20455569&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=1&currentPage=0}}</ref> Damage throughout the Lesser Antilles totaled $1&nbsp;million (1950&nbsp;USD, ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|1000000|1950|2009|r=-4}}}} 2009&nbsp;USD), primarily on Antigua and Barbuda and included many damaged or destroyed homes, ruined crops, blocked roads from washouts or fallen trees, and power outages across the islands. The passage of the hurricane resulted in several shipwrecks; two people drowned when their small boat capsized.<ref name="mwr"/> The hurricane sank a boat on the island of [[Saint-Barthélemy]], where damage amounted to $70,000 (1950&nbsp;USD, ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|70000|1950|2009}}|-4}} 2009&nbsp;USD).<ref name="stbar">{{cite web|author=Edouard Magras|year=2006|title=St-Barth Weekly|publisher=Le Journal de Saint-Barth|accessdate=2007-04-01|url=http://www.st-barths.com/jsb/pdf_files/weekly82.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>

In the [[Mid-Atlantic States]], heavy levels of precipitation were reported, leading to [[flash flood]]s in some locations. In [[Bel Air, Harford County, Maryland|Bel Aire, Maryland]], a car drove into the swollen [[Gunpowder River]]; three people in the car drowned and a fourth was injured. A further two people drowned in [[Lexington, Virginia]]. Though newspaper sources attributed the heavy rainfall to Hurricane Dog,<ref name="ls912"/> this was not confirmed.<ref name="mwr"/>

The hurricane produced high tides and rough surf along the [[East Coast of the United States]], with coastal flooding reported along some beaches in [[Rhode Island]].<ref name="ap911"/> The hurricane capsized or damaged several boats along the coastline, including two large vessels in [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]]. In [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]], the surf grounded at least 15 vessels from the harbor onto a coastal causeway. Near [[Cape Cod]], damage to fishermen's assets totaled $150,000 (1950&nbsp;USD, ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|150000|1950|2009}}|1}} 2009&nbsp;USD). Tides along Nantucket were reported at the highest levels since the [[1944 Great Atlantic Hurricane]].<ref name="ls912"/> Hurricane Dog produced powerful wind gusts along coastal areas of [[New England]], which caused widespread power outages, including a loss of power to 15 towns on Cape Cod, to hundreds of residences on Nantucket, and to several other locations in the area. Additionally, winds from the hurricane destroyed two small barns and uprooted a few trees, some of which blocked roads.<ref name="ls912"/> The hurricane deposited light to moderate rainfall across southeastern [[Massachusetts]], ranging from around {{convert|1|in|mm|0}} to about 4 to 5&nbsp;inches (100 to 125&nbsp;mm) near [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]].<ref name="etdog">{{cite web|author=National Weather Service and the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the University at Albany: State University of New York|year=2001|title=41 Tropical Cyclones producing > 4&nbsp;inches of rainfall in the Northeast U.S. during the period 1950 – 2001|accessdate=2007-04-01|url=http://www.atmos.albany.edu/student/deluca/Season2.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref><ref name="dog50">{{cite web|author=National Weather Service and the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the University at Albany: State University of New York|year=2001|title=Hurricane Dog Storm Track and Precipitation|accessdate=2007-04-01|url=http://www.atmos.albany.edu/student/deluca/dog1950.ps.gif}}</ref> In [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]], a car hit a woman&mdash;neither the driver nor the victim were able to see due to the rains.

In all, 12&nbsp;people died in [[New England]] as a result of the hurricane.<ref name="mwr"/>

==Naming, records and aftermath==
During the 1950, [[1951 Atlantic hurricane season|1951]], and [[1952 Atlantic hurricane season|1952]] seasons, [[Atlantic hurricane]]s were named using the [[Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet]].<ref name="atwc">{{cite web|author=Atlantic Tropical Weather Center|year=2003|title=Tropical cyclone naming|accessdate=2007-04-02|url=http://www.atwc.org/athist.txt}}</ref> However, Hurricane Dog was referred to as "the great hurricane in the central Atlantic" in newspaper reports, and its name was seldom used.<ref name="cp92"/> Operationally, hurricanes were not referred to by name until 1952.<ref name="ap83152">{{cite news|author=O'Neil Hendrick|date=1952-08-31|title=Coastal City Whipped by Hurricane|publisher=Associated Press|accessdate=2007-04-02|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=33303397&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=5&currentPage=0}}</ref>

Hurricane Dog retains the record for longest continuous duration for a Category&nbsp;5 [[Atlantic hurricane]], although [[Hurricane Allen]] spent longer total time as a [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale|Category 5]]. On September 4, Hurricane Dog was one of three simultaneous Atlantic hurricanes, along with [[1950 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Charlie|Charlie]] and [[Hurricane Easy (1950)|Easy]]. This is a rare occurrence in the Atlantic Ocean, and has only happened six times since 1950&mdash;in [[1961 Atlantic hurricane season|1961]], [[1967 Atlantic hurricane season|1967]], [[1980 Atlantic hurricane season|1980]], [[1995 Atlantic hurricane season|1995]], [[1998 Atlantic hurricane season|1998]], and [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season|2005]]. This also occurred on August 31 with Baker, Charlie and Dog.<ref name="hurdat"/>

Additionally, Dog remains one of only three Category&nbsp;5 hurricanes in the [[Atlantic hurricane reanalysis|historical database]] to avoid land&mdash;the others were [[Hurricane Easy (1951)|Easy]] and [[Hurricane Cleo (1958)|Cleo]], both of which also occurred in the 1950s.<ref name="hurdat"/>

In the aftermath of the hurricane, the newspaper ''[[The Daily Gleaner]]'' started a hurricane relief fund and requested its readersto assist the country of [[Antigua]]. Four days after the hurricane, the fund totaled ₤171,000 (1950&nbsp;[[Pound sterling|GBP]], ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|{{#expr:(171000/0.35714)}}|1950|2009}}|2}} 2009&nbsp;USD). One Antigua official stated the country "would appreciate voluntary assistance from outside, especially food and clothing".<!--what does this mean?--><ref name="dg905">{{cite news|author=Staff Writer|date=1950-09-05|title=Gleaner Opens Antigua Fund|publisher=The Daily Gleaner|accessdate=2007-04-02|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=20455571&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=0&currentPage=0}}</ref> Relief aid was also sent from the United States to the affected islands.<ref name="ap912aid">{{cite news|author=Associated Press|date=1950-09-12|title=Hurricane Relief Rushed|accessdate=2007-04-02|url=http://www.thehurricanearchive.com/Viewer.aspx?img=54883554&firstvisit=true&src=search&currentResult=4&currentPage=10}}</ref>
