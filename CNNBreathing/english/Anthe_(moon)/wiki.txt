'''Anthe''' ({{pronEng|ˈænθiː}} {{respell|AN|thee}},<ref>This name is too new to appear in dictionaries, but the [[OED]] has the analogous ''rhodanthe'' {{IPA|/roʊˈdænθiː/}}.</ref> or as Greek ''Άνθη)'' is a very small [[natural satellite]] of [[Saturn]] lying between the orbits of [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] and [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]]. It is also known as Saturn XLIX; its provisional designation was S/2007 S 4. It is named after one of the [[Alkyonides]]; the name means ''flowery''.  It is the 60th confirmed moon of Saturn.<ref name=jpl>{{cite web

It was discovered by the [http://ciclops.org/team/iss_team.php Cassini Imaging Team] in images taken on May 30, 2007.<ref name="IAUC"/> Once the discovery was made, a search of older Cassini images revealed this small satellite in observations from as far back as June 2004. It was first announced on July 18, 2007.<ref name="IAUC"/>

Anthe is visibly affected by a perturbing mean longitude [[orbital resonance|resonance]] with the much larger Mimas. This causes its [[osculating orbit]]al elements to vary with an amplitude of about 20&nbsp;km in semi-major axis on a timescale of about 2 Earth years. The close proximity to the orbits of [[Pallene (moon)|Pallene]] and [[Methone (moon)|Methone]] suggests that these moons may form a dynamical family.
