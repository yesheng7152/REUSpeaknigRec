"'''Spinning Around'''" is a song recorded by Australian singer [[Kylie Minogue]] for her seventh [[studio album]] ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]]'' (2000). Written by Ira Shickman, Osborne Bingham, [[Kara DioGuardi]], and [[Paula Abdul]], "Spinning Around" was initially meant to be recorded by Abdul for her own album, but was given to Minogue after the plan never came to fruition. The [[Disco music|disco]]-influenced [[dance-pop]] song was then released as the [[lead single]] from ''Light Years'' on 13 June 2000. Lyrically, the song addresses the theme of reinvention, with Minogue claiming that she has changed as a person and learned from the past.

Upon its release, "Spinning Around" received favourable reviews from [[music critics]], who singled it out as one of the highlights from the album and praised Minogue for returning to her signature musical style. Commercially, the song was a success and became Minogue's "[[comeback]]" single following the critical and commercial disappointment of her sixth studio album ''[[Impossible Princess]]'' (1997).<ref name=uktotalnumberones /> It entered the [[Australian Singles Chart]] at number one, becoming the singer's first chart-topper since "[[Confide in Me]]" (1994). The song also debuted at number one in the United Kingdom, where it became her first single to peak atop the chart in a decade. Elsewhere, it reached the top five in Ireland and New Zealand. "Spinning Around" was [[Record certification|certified]] [[Platinum certification|platinum]] and [[Silver certification|silver]] in Australia and the United Kingdom, respectively.

The accompanying music video for "Spinning Around" was directed by [[Dawn Shadforth]], and features Minogue dancing and enjoying herself in a disco. It became popular for the gold [[hotpants]] she sported in most of the scenes and led to her bottom gaining extensive coverage from the media. The hotpants are considered to be "iconic" and have been displayed in fashion exhibitions Minogue has been subject of. "Spinning Around" has been performed by Minogue during all of her concert tours, with the exception of the [[Anti Tour]].

== Background and composition ==

In 1997, Minogue released her sixth studio album ''[[Impossible Princess]]''. The album represented a drastic change in the singer's musical direction, shifting from her signature [[dance-pop]] styles to incorporate elements of [[electronica]] and [[pop rock]].<ref name=impossibleslant>{{cite web|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|title=Kylie Minogue: Impossible Princess|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/kylie-minogue-impossible-princess/371|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=19 November 2003}}</ref> It was her second album to be released on British record label [[Deconstruction Records|Deconstruction]] and became a success in her native Australia, peaking at number four on the [[ARIA Albums Chart]].<ref name=impossibleaustralianchart>{{cite web|title=Kylie Minogue - Impossible Princess (Album)|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Kylie+Minogue&titel=Impossible+Princess&cat=a|publisher=Australian Charts.

They also deemed Minogue's career over. Despite embarking on a successful [[Intimate and Live (concert tour)|promotional tour]], she was dropped from Deconstruction in 1999. Minogue then signed to [[Parlophone]], another British record label.<ref name=kyliebioallmusic>{{cite web|last=True|first=Chris|title=Kylie Minogue - Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kylie-minogue-mn0000776093/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]].

After various discussions, Minogue decided to do what she did "best" and record a simple [[Pop music|pop]] album inspired by [[Disco music|disco]] and [[Europop]], entitled ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]]''.<ref name=reviewallmusic>{{cite web|last=True|first=Chris|title=Light Years - Kylie Minogue|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/light-years-mw0000464935|publisher=AllMusic.

Similar to most of the songs from ''Light Years'', "Spinning Around" is a "[[String instrument|string]]-laden" dance-pop track with prominent influences from disco music.<ref name=reviewallmusic /><ref name=reviewdigispy /> According to the [[sheet music]] of the song published by [[BMG Rights Management]] at Musicnotes.com, it is composed in the key of [[F minor|F# minor]] and features a moderate [[Tempo (music)|tempo]] of 120 beats per minute.<ref name=sheetmusicnotes.com>{{cite web|title=Spinning Around|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdFPE.asp?ppn=MN0074844&|publisher=Musicnotes.com.

The first verse deals with Minogue ridding herself of items and symbols from her past and starting afresh, evidenced in lines like "Threw away my old clothes, got myself a better wardrobe." The critic felt that in the second verse Minogue faces her mistakes and accepts herself as she is. The [[Bridge (music)|bridge]] of the song features the repetition of the hook "You know you like it like this," with Minogue's voice being [[Vocoder|vocoded]].<ref name=reviewblogcritics /> Chris True from [[AllMusic]] felt that through the lyrics, Minogue was admitting that releasing ''Impossible Princess'' in 1997 was not the best decision.<ref name=reviewallmusic />

== Critical reaction ==
"Spinning Around" received favourable reviews from [[music critics]]. Chris True from AllMusic selected it as a highlight from the album and said it was a "fun and string-laden declaration that she may have made a mistake back in 1997."<ref name=reviewallmusic /> Pom Avoledo from [[Blogcritics]] praised Minogue for returning to her signature dance-pop style and complimented her for giving "Spinning Around" an "air of elegance and sensuality which was lacking in her early material."<ref name=reviewblogcritics>{{cite web|last=Avoledo|first=Pam|title=Single Review: Kylie Minogue "Spinning Around"|url=http://blogcritics.org/single-review-kylie-minogue-spinning-around/|publisher=[[Blogcritics]].

=== Development and synopsis ===
The accompanying [[music video]] for "Spinning Around" was directed by [[Dawn Shadforth]].<ref name=videoimvdb>{{cite web|title=Spinning Around (2000)|url=http://imvdb.com/video/kylie-minogue/spinning-around|publisher=IMVDb. FilmedInsert, LLC|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref> As the song was meant to be Minogue's "[[comeback]]" single and mark a "decisive return" to pop music following ''Impossible Princess'', the video did not contain any dark themes and put the "emphasis firmly upon dance, fun, and freedom."<ref name=legacyleebarronjournal>{{cite journal|last=Barron|first=Lee|title=The Seven Ages of Kylie Minogue: Postmodernism, Identity,  and Performative Mimicry|journal=Nebula|date=December 2008|page=13|url=http://www.nobleworld.biz/images/Barron.pdf|accessdate=6 October 2013}}</ref> The video begins with a shot of Minogue's feet as she enters a disco-like setting. She is then shown dancing on the floor with a man,  whom she  later flirts with on a sofa. Scenes of her performing a dance routine on and in front of a bar and laying on neon blue and gold lights are interspersed throughout the video. Most of the shots are focused on Minogue's body and various scenes feature her wearing gold [[Lamé (fabric)|lamé]] [[hotpants]].<ref name=legacyleebarronjournal />

{{Quote box
 |quote  = I went through years of rejection, and my first thing was Kylie [Minogue recording "Spinning Around" in 2000]. I didn't know who Kylie was, and I was heartbroken that [[Paula Abdul]] wasn't going to do it. I was thinking, "Kylie Minogue? Who's Kylie Minogue? I got to make some money or I'm going to have to go back to my real job." And then I saw her ass in the video -- she had these hot pants on and the video was sick -- and I was like, "OK, I like Kylie Minogue. I'm going to make some money here."
