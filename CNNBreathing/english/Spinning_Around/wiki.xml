&quot;'''Spinning Around'''&quot; is a song recorded by Australian singer [[Kylie Minogue]] for her seventh [[studio album]] ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]]'' (2000). Written by Ira Shickman, Osborne Bingham, [[Kara DioGuardi]], and [[Paula Abdul]], &quot;Spinning Around&quot; was initially meant to be recorded by Abdul for her own album, but was given to Minogue after the plan never came to fruition. The [[Disco music|disco]]-influenced [[dance-pop]] song was then released as the [[lead single]] from ''Light Years'' on 13 June 2000. Lyrically, the song addresses the theme of reinvention, with Minogue claiming that she has changed as a person and learned from the past.

Upon its release, &quot;Spinning Around&quot; received favourable reviews from [[music critics]], who singled it out as one of the highlights from the album and praised Minogue for returning to her signature musical style. Commercially, the song was a success and became Minogue's &quot;[[comeback]]&quot; single following the critical and commercial disappointment of her sixth studio album ''[[Impossible Princess]]'' (1997).<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=uktotalnumberones </attr></ext> It entered the [[Australian Singles Chart]] at number one, becoming the singer's first chart-topper since &quot;[[Confide in Me]]&quot; (1994). The song also debuted at number one in the United Kingdom, where it became her first single to peak atop the chart in a decade. Elsewhere, it reached the top five in Ireland and New Zealand. &quot;Spinning Around&quot; was [[Record certification|certified]] [[Platinum certification|platinum]] and [[Silver certification|silver]] in Australia and the United Kingdom, respectively.

The accompanying music video for &quot;Spinning Around&quot; was directed by [[Dawn Shadforth]], and features Minogue dancing and enjoying herself in a disco. It became popular for the gold [[hotpants]] she sported in most of the scenes and led to her bottom gaining extensive coverage from the media. The hotpants are considered to be &quot;iconic&quot; and have been displayed in fashion exhibitions Minogue has been subject of. &quot;Spinning Around&quot; has been performed by Minogue during all of her concert tours, with the exception of the [[Anti Tour]].

In 1997, Minogue released her sixth studio album ''[[Impossible Princess]]''. The album represented a drastic change in the singer's musical direction, shifting from her signature [[dance-pop]] styles to incorporate elements of [[electronica]] and [[pop rock]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=impossibleslant</attr><inner>{{cite web|last=Cinquemani|first=Sal|title=Kylie Minogue: Impossible Princess|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/kylie-minogue-impossible-princess/371|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]|accessdate=9 December 2013|date=19 November 2003}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> It was her second album to be released on British record label [[Deconstruction Records|Deconstruction]] and became a success in her native Australia, peaking at number four on the [[ARIA Albums Chart]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=impossibleaustralianchart</attr><inner>{{cite web|title=Kylie Minogue - Impossible Princess (Album)|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Kylie+Minogue&amp;titel=Impossible+Princess&amp;cat=a|publisher=Australian Charts.

They also deemed Minogue's career over. Despite embarking on a successful [[Intimate and Live (concert tour)|promotional tour]], she was dropped from Deconstruction in 1999.

She is then shown dancing on the floor with a man,  whom she  later flirts with on a sofa. Scenes of her performing a dance routine on and in front of a bar and laying on neon blue and gold lights are interspersed throughout the video. Most of the shots are focused on Minogue's body and various scenes feature her wearing gold [[Lamé (fabric)|lamé]] [[hotpants]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=legacyleebarronjournal </attr></ext>

I got to make some money or I'm going to have to go back to my real job.&quot; And then I saw her ass in the video -- she had these hot pants on and the video was sick -- and I was like, &quot;OK, I like Kylie Minogue.
