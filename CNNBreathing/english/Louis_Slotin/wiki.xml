'''Louis Alexander Slotin''' ([[December 1]], [[1910]] – [[May 30]], [[1946]]) was a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[physicist]] and [[chemist]] who took part in the [[Manhattan Project]]. He was born and raised in the [[North End, Winnipeg, Manitoba|North End]] of [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]. After earning both his [[Bachelor of Science]] and [[Master of Science]] degrees from the [[University of Manitoba]], Slotin attended [[King's College London]], where he obtained his doctorate in physical chemistry in 1936. Afterwards, he joined the [[University of Chicago]] as a research associate to help design a [[cyclotron]]. In 1942, he was invited to participate in the Manhattan Project.

As part of the Manhattan Project, Slotin performed experiments with [[uranium]] and [[plutonium]] cores to determine their [[critical mass]] values. After World War II, Slotin continued his research at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. On [[May 21]], [[1946]], Slotin accidentally began a fission reaction, which released a burst of [[hard radiation]]. Slotin was rushed to the hospital, and died nine days later on [[May 30]], the victim of the second [[criticality accident]] in history.

Slotin was hailed as a hero by the United States government for reacting quickly enough to prevent the deaths of his colleagues. However, some physicists argue that this was a preventable accident. The accident and its aftermath have been dramatized in fiction.

<h level="2" i="1">==Early life==</h>
Slotin was the first of three children born to Israel and Sonia Slotin, [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]-speaking refugees who had fled the [[pogrom]]s of [[Russia]] to [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite journal |last=Zeilig |first=Martin |year=1995 |month=August/September |title=Louis Slotin And 'The Invisible Killer' |journal=The Beaver |volume=75 |issue=4 |pages=20-27 |url=http://hhs55.com/slotin.html |accessdate= 2007-11-20}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> He grew up in the North End neighborhood of Winnipeg, an area with a large concentration of [[Eastern Europe]]an immigrants. From his early days at Machray Elementary School through his teenage years at [[St. John's Technical High School]], Slotin was academically exceptional. His younger brother, Sam, later remarked that his brother &quot;had an extreme intensity that enabled him to study long hours.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;</attr></ext> At the age of 16, Slotin entered the [[University of Manitoba]], to pursue a degree in science. During his undergraduate years, he received a University Gold Medal in both physics and chemistry. Slotin received a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[geology]] from the university in 1932 and a [[Master of Science]] degree in 1933. With the assistance of one of his mentors, he obtained a fellowship to study at [[King's College London]], under the supervision of [[Arthur John Allmand]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;</attr></ext> the chair of the chemistry of the department, who specialized in the field of applied [[electrochemistry]] and [[photochemistry]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal |last= |first= |year=1951 |month= |title=In memoriam: Arthur John Allmand, 1885–1951 |journal=[[Faraday Transactions|Journal of the Chemical Society, Faraday Transactions]] |volume=47 |issue= |pages=X001 - X003 |url=http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayArticleForFree.cfm?doi=TF951470X001&amp;JournalCode=TF |doi= 10.1039/TF951470X001|accessdate= 2007-12-19}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="3" i="2">===King's College===</h>
While at King's College, Slotin distinguished himself as an [[amateur boxing|amateur boxer]] by winning the college's amateur bantamweight boxing championship. Later, he gave the impression that he had fought for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] and flown fighter jets with the [[Royal Air Force]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Obit&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite journal |last=Anderson |first=H.

<h level="3" i="3">===University of Chicago===</h>
In 1937, after unsuccessfully applying for a job with Canada's [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council]], the [[University of Chicago]] accepted him as a research associate. There, Slotin gained his first experience with nuclear chemistry, helping to build the first [[cyclotron]] in the midwestern United States.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;science.ca&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web| title = science.ca Profile: Louis Slotin| publisher = GCS Research Society | author = | date = 2007-11-07 | url = http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=290&amp;pg=0| accessdate = 2007-11-21 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The job paid poorly and Slotin's father had to support him for two years. From 1939 to 1940, Slotin collaborated with Earl Evans, the head of the university's biochemistry department, to produce radiocarbon ([[carbon-14]] and [[carbon-11]]) from the cyclotron.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;</attr></ext> While working together, the two men also used carbon-11 to demonstrate that [[Eukaryote#Animal cell|animal cell]]s had the capacity to use [[carbon dioxide]] for [[carbohydrate metabolism|carbohydrate synthesis]], through [[carbon fixation]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web| title = Earl Evans, 1910-1999| publisher = [[University of Chicago Medical Center]] | author = | date = 1999-10-05 | url = http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/1999/19991005-evansobit.html| accessdate = 2007-12-20 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Slotin may have been present at the start-up of [[Enrico Fermi]]'s &quot;[[Chicago Pile-1]]&quot;, the first [[nuclear reactor]], on [[December 2]], [[1942]]; however, the accounts of the event do not agree on this point.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>A 1962 University of Chicago document says that Slotin &quot;was present on [[December 2]], [[1942]], when the group of 'Met Lab' [Metallurgical Laboratory] scientists working under the late Enrico Fermi achieved man's first self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in a pile of [[graphite]] and uranium under the West Stands of [[Stagg Field]].&quot; Slotin's colleague, Henry W. Newson, recollected that he and Slotin were not present during the scientists' experimentation.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> During this time, Slotin also contributed to a number of papers in the field of [[radiobiology]]. His expertise on the subject garnered the attention of the United States government, and as a result he was invited to join the [[Manhattan Project]], the United States' effort to develop a nuclear bomb.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;science.ca&quot;</attr></ext> Slotin worked on the production of plutonium under future [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]] [[Eugene Wigner]] at the university and later at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], [[Tennessee]]. He moved to the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in [[New Mexico]] in December 1944 to work in the bomb physics group of [[Robert Bacher]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;</attr></ext>

<h level="2" i="4">==Los Alamos==</h>
At Los Alamos, Slotin's duties consisted of dangerous [[Critical mass|criticality]] testing, first with [[uranium]] in [[Otto Robert Frisch|Otto Robert Frisch's]] experiments, and later with [[plutonium]] cores. Criticality testing involved bringing masses of [[fissile]] materials to near-critical levels in order to establish their [[critical mass]] values.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Martin&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=Brigitt |year=1999 |month=December |title=The Secret Life of Louis Slotin 1910 - 1946 |journal= Alumni Journal of the University of Manitoba |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages= | url=http://www.cns-snc.ca/history/pioneers/slotin/slotin.html |accessdate= 2007-11-22}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Scientists referred to this flirting with the possibility of a [[nuclear chain reaction]] as &quot;tickling the dragon's tail&quot;, after a remark by physicist [[Richard Feynman]] who compared the experiments to &quot;tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;NYT&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite news |last= Weber |first= Bruce |title=Theater Review; A Scientist's Tragic Hubris Attains Critical Mass Onstage |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DB1E3EF933A25757C0A9679C8B63 |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2001-04-10 |accessdate=2007-11-22 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal |last= |first= |month=November/December |year=2002 |title=Science as Theater: The Slip of the Screwdriver |journal=[[American Scientist]] |publisher=[[Sigma Xi]] |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=550-555 |accessdate= 2007-11-26}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> On [[July 16]], [[1945]], Slotin assembled the core for [[Trinity test|Trinity]], the first detonated atomic bomb.

After the war, Slotin expressed growing disdain for his personal involvement in the project. He remarked, &quot;I have become involved in the Navy tests, much to my disgust.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;</attr></ext> Unfortunately for Slotin, his participation at Los Alamos was still required because, as he said, &quot;I am one of the few people left here who are experienced bomb putter-togetherers.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;</attr></ext> He looked forward to resuming his research into [[biophysics]] and radiobiology at the University of Chicago and was training a replacement, Alvin C.

On [[August 21]], [[1945]], [[Harry K. Daghlian, Jr.|Harry K.

[[Image:Tickling the Dragons Tail.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A re-creation of the incident.]]
On [[May 21]], [[1946]], Slotin and seven other colleagues performed an experiment that involved the creation of one of the first steps of a fission reaction by placing two half-spheres of [[beryllium]] (a neutron reflector) around a plutonium core. The experiment used the same <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>6.2</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>kg</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>lb</value></part><part><name index="4"/><value>1</value></part><part><name>sing</name><equals>=</equals><value>on</value></part></template> plutonium core that had irradiated Daghlian. Slotin grasped the upper beryllium hemisphere with his left hand through a thumb hole at the top while he maintained the separation of the half-spheres using the blade of a screwdriver with his right hand, having removed the [[shim]]s normally used.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;</attr></ext> Using a screwdriver was not a normal part of the experimental protocol. 

At 3:20 p.m., the screwdriver slipped and the upper beryllium hemisphere fell, causing a &quot;[[prompt critical]]&quot; reaction and a burst of [[hard radiation]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Martin&quot;</attr></ext> At the time, the scientists in the room observed the &quot;blue glow&quot; of air ionization and felt a &quot;heat wave&quot;. In addition, Slotin experienced a sour taste in his mouth and an intense burning sensation in his left hand.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;</attr></ext> Slotin instinctively jerked his left hand upward, lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to the floor. He exposed himself to a lethal dose (around 2100 rems, or 21 Sv) of neutron and gamma radiation.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;la-13638&quot;</attr></ext> (Slotin's radiation dose was identical to the amount he would have received had he been 4800 feet (1463 m) away from the detonation of an atomic bomb.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Millerp69&quot;</attr></ext>)

As soon as Slotin left the building, he [[Vomiting|vomited]], a common reaction from exposure to extremely intense ionizing radiation.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;</attr></ext> Slotin's colleagues rushed him to the hospital, but irreversible damage had already been done.

At first, the incident was classified and not made known even within the laboratory; [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and other colleagues later reported severe emotional distress at having to carry on with normal work and social activities while they secretly knew that their colleague lay dying.

Louis Slotin died nine days later on [[May 30]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book | editor= Chris Austell | title=Decision-Making in the Nuclear Age | publisher= Halcyon Press| location=[[Weston, Massachusetts|Weston]], [[Massachusetts]] | year = 1983 |isbn= | pages= 353}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> in the presence of his parents.

The core, which later was termed the &quot;[[Demon core]]&quot; due to the accidents it had led to, was subject to a number of experiments shortly after the end of the war and was used in the ABLE detonation, during the [[Operation Crossroads|Crossroads]] series of nuclear weapon testing.

On [[June 14]], [[1946]], the associate editor of the ''Los Alamos Times'', Thomas P. Ashlock, penned a poem entitled &quot;Slotin - A Tribute&quot;: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''May God receive you, great-souled scientist!''&lt;br&gt;
''While you were with us, even strangers knew''&lt;br&gt;
''The breadth and lofty stature of your mind''&lt;br&gt;
''Twas only in the crucible of death&lt;br&gt;''
''We saw at last your noble heart revealed.''<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;</attr></ext>&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The official story released at the time was that Slotin, by quickly removing the upper hemisphere, was a hero for ending the critical reaction and protecting seven other observers in the room: &quot;Dr. Slotin's quick reaction at the immediate risk of his own life prevented a more serious development of the experiment which would certainly have resulted in the death of the seven men working with him, as well as serious injury to others in the general vicinity.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;</attr></ext> However, Robert B. Brode, a top physicist who worked on the project, argued that the accident was avoidable and that Slotin was not using proper procedures, endangering the others in the lab along with himself.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;</attr></ext> In 1948, Slotin's colleagues at Los Alamos and the University of Chicago initiated the ''Louis A. Slotin Memorial Fund'' for lectures on physics given by distinguished scientists such as Robert Oppenheimer and Nobel laureates [[Luis Walter Alvarez]] and [[Hans Bethe]]. The memorial fund lasted until 1962.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;zeilig22&quot;</attr></ext>
