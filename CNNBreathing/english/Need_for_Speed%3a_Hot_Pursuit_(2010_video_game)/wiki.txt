==Gameplay==
[[File:HotPursuit2010 screenshot.png|thumb|left|''Hot Pursuit'' allows players to control police vehicles and participate in high-speed pursuits, a feature absent from the series since 2002.]]
''Hot Pursuit'' goes back to the ''Need for Speed'' series' roots and takes on the gameplay style of earlier "Hot Pursuit" titles in the ''Need for Speed'' [[media franchise|franchise]] with [[exotic car]]s and high-speed [[police chase]]s. It is primarily inspired by [[The Need for Speed|the original ''Need for Speed'']] on [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]].{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} ''Hot Pursuit'' lets players be either a cop or a racer and features a full career mode for both roles. The relationship between the cops and racers is described as "a dog chasing down a rabbit", with the cops being more powerful compared to the racers. Each side has several power-ups including calling for [[roadblock]]s and [[radar jamming]].<ref name="gamespot hands-on">{{cite web |url=http://e3.gamespot.com/story/6265399/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-hands-on |title=E3 2010: Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Hands-On |date=2010-06-15 |author=Guy Cocker |publisher=[[GameSpot|GameSpot UK]] |accessdate=2010-06-15 }}</ref>  

The game takes place in fictional location known as Seacrest County.<ref name="gamespot hands-on" /> It's an [[open world]] and features over {{convert|100|mi}} of open road, four times larger than that of ''[[Burnout Paradise]]'', Criterion's previous title.<ref name="100 miles">{{cite web |url=http://twitter.com/CriterionGames/status/16407400612 |title=Over 100 miles of open road |publisher=[[Criterion Games]] (via [[Twitter]]) |date=2010-06-17 |accessdate=2010-06-24 }}</ref> According to Criterion the single-player section is somewhere between 12–15 hours long, but with lots of replay value.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamer.no/artikler/71459/sniktitt-need-for-speed-hot-pursuit/ |title=Preview: Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit |publisher=Gamer.no |date=2010-10-23 |accessdate=2010-10-31 }}</ref>  ''Hot Pursuit'' also features a new social interaction system called "Autolog" described as "Facebook for the game".<ref name="criterion">{{cite web |url=http://www.criteriongames.com/NFS/ |title=Criterion Games presents Need for Speed Hot Pursuit |publisher=[[Criterion Games]] |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> The game features both single-player and multiplayer game modes with up to eight players; as an option to live multiplayer racing, players can post records and achievements on the Autolog feed for friends to see, which they then can try to beat.

==Development==
The game was first hinted at during [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010|E3 2009]] by [[EA]]’s CEO, [[John Riccitiello]]. Riccitiello stated that [[Criterion Games]], developers of EA's own [[Burnout (series)|''Burnout'' series]], was working on a "revolutionary" addition to the ''Need for Speed'' franchise, stating "We don't have a plan right now for a separate major launch on ''Burnout'', because the team doing it is working on a revolutionary take on ''Need for Speed''."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5285730/ea-burnout-devs-making-revolutionary-need-for-speed |title=EA: Burnot Devs Making "Revolutionary" Need for Speed |author=Stephen Totilo |date=2009-06-10 |publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=2009-06-16 }}</ref> It was also reported that the game was scheduled for release in [[Fourth quarter of a calendar year|Q4]] 2010.<ref name="Primotech">{{cite web |url=http://www.primotechnology.com/2009/05/14/criterion-developing-need-for-speed-title-for-release-in-2010/ |title=Criterion Developing Need for Sped Title for Release in 2010 |author=Alex Petraglia |date=2009-05-14 |publisher=Primotech |accessdate=2009-10-26 }}</ref>  It was officially revealed as ''Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit'' at EA's Media Briefing during [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010|E3 2010]]. with a trailer which showed a high-speed police chase involving three different racers. The trailer was followed by a live demo of the game on stage between creative director Craig Sullivan as a cop and producer Matt Webster as a racer.<ref name="reveal">{{cite web |url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/e3-2010-need-for/101352|title=Need for Speed E3 Reveal |publisher=[[GameTrailers]] |date=2010-06-14 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}</ref> According to Riccitiello, the game was in development for two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=265540 |title=EA: We ruined Need For Speed with studio 'death march' |publisher=Computerandvideogames.com |date=2010-09-20 |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref>

In August, before ''Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit'' was set to take center stage at EA's press conference during [[Gamescom]], it was announced by Art Director Henry LaBounta that Criterion collaborated with [[EA Digital Illusions CE|DICE]] in building the massive open world of ''Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-dice-criterion-need-for-speed-blog-entry |title=How DICE collaborated on Need for Speed's game world |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=2010-08-14|accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref> Early in November, Patrick Söderlund, Senior Vice President of EA Games Europe, said this of the collaboration: "I think the most important thing, when you have two high-quality developers working together, for it to work, they need to have mutual respect. They need to have that respect, to say ‘Ok, we trust you to do this.’ This was a case where that was so obvious, where the Criterion team had a full trust in the DICE team to do what they were doing, and vice versa."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gamerant.com/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-interview-patrick-soderlund-phil-49461/ |title=‘Need for Speed Hot Pursuit’ Interview with Patrick Söderlund  |publisher=Gamerant.com |date=2010-11-02|accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref>

Recent games in the ''Need for Speed'' franchise included a story, but Matt Webster, producer of ''Hot Pursuit'' said  "We didn’t really think it was necessary to include a story. If you’re a cop, the aim is to go up the ranks, while a racer’s aim is to get to the highest rank they can."<ref>{{cite web|author=Justin |url=http://mmomfg.com/2010/09/28/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-plot-0928/ |title=Need for Speed Hot Pursuit full of speed and cars, not so much on plot |publisher=mmomfg.com |date=2010-09-28 |accessdate=2010-10-13}}</ref> UK product manager for ''Need for Speed'' Kevin Flynn said that "''[[Need for Speed: Shift|Shift]]'' was a great game but different and a bit serious, while ''Hot Pursuit'' is more fun and accessible."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/41175/Hot-Pursuit-is-best-NFS-yet |title=Hot Pursuit 'is best NFS yet' |publisher=Mcvuk.com |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref> In October, the trophy list for the PlayStation 3 and soundtrack for ''Hot Pursuit'' were leaked onto the internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=270060 |title=NFS: Hot Pursuit trophy list |publisher=[[Computer and Video Games]] |date=2010-10-17 |accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref>  Early in November did analyst Mike Hickey say he believes EA's ''Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit'' could sell 4.2 million copies during holidays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/31362/Analyst_EAs_Need_For_Speed_Hot_Pursuit_Could_Sell_42m_During_Holidays.php |title=Analyst: EA's Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit Could Sell 4.2m During Holidays |publisher=Gamasutra.com |date=2010-11-04|accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/news/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-to-sell-42-million-generate-185-million-says-analyst/|title=Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit to Sell 4.2 Million, Generate $185 Million, says Analyst |publisher=Gamasutra.com |date=2010-11-04|accessdate=2010-11-08}}</ref>

Each stop featured recording artists and showcased an assortment of exotic cars.
