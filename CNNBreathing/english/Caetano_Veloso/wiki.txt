'''Caetano Emanuel Viana Teles Veloso''' ({{IPA-pt|kaeˈtɐ̃nu emanuˈɛw viˈɐ̃nɐ ˈtɛlis veˈlozu}}; born August 7, 1942), better known as '''Caetano Veloso''', is a [[Brazil]]ian [[composer]], singer, [[guitarist]], writer, and [[activism|political activist]]. Veloso first became known for his participation in the Brazilian musical movement [[Tropicália|Tropicalismo]], which encompassed theatre, poetry and music in the 1960s, at the beginning of the [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|Brazilian military dictatorship]]. He has remained a constant creative influence and best-selling performing artist and composer ever since. Veloso has won nine [[Latin Grammy Awards]] and two [[Grammy Awards]]. On November 14, [[Latin Grammy Awards of 2012|2012]], Veloso was honored as the [[Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year]].<ref name="grammy.com">[http://www.grammy.com/news/caetano-veloso-named-latin-recording-academy-person-of-the-year Caetano Veloso Named Latin Recording Academy Person Of The Year]</ref>

Veloso was one of seven children born into the family of José Teles Velloso (''Seu Zeca''), a government official, and Claudionor Viana Teles Velloso (''Dona Canô''), a housewife.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://iurirubim.blog.terra.com.br/2009/03/20/ba-aos-101-anos-d-cano-velloso-publica-livro-de-memorias/|title=''BA: Aos 101 anos, D. Canô Velloso publica livro de memórias''|last=Fernandes|first=Bob|publisher=Terra Magazine ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]])|date=2009-03-20|accessdate=2013-01-01}}</ref> He was born in the city of Santo Amaro da Purificação, in [[Bahia]], a state in the northeastern area of Brazil, but moved to Salvador, the state capital, as a college student in the mid-1960s. Soon after the move, Veloso won a music contest and was signed to his first [[record label|label]]. He became one of the founders of [[Tropicália|Tropicalismo]] with a group of several other musicians and artists&mdash;including his sister [[Maria Bethânia]]&mdash;in the same period. However the Brazilian government at the time viewed Veloso's music and political action as threatening, and he was arrested, along with fellow musician [[Gilberto Gil]], in 1969. The two eventually were exiled from Brazil, and went to London, where they lived for two years. After he moved back to his home country, in 1972, Veloso once again began recording and performing, becoming popular outside of Brazil in the 1980s and 1990s.

=== Early years (1942–1969) ===
{{listen|filename=O Leãozinho.ogg|title="O Leãozinho"|description=A 19 second sample of "O Leãozinho", a song recorded relatively early in Veloso's career.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Veloso was born in [[Santo Amaro, Bahia|Santo Amaro da Purificação]], Bahia, the fifth of seven children of José Teles Veloso (1901–1983) and Claudionor Viana Teles Veloso (1907–2012). His childhood was influenced greatly by artistic endeavors: he was interested in both literature and filmmaking as a child, but focused mainly on music. The musical style of [[bossa nova]] and [[João Gilberto]], one of its most prominent exponents, were major influences on Veloso's music as he grew up.<ref name=manning>{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Manning |title=The Life of Caetano Veloso |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/veloso/biography.html |work=[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|Online NewsHour]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |accessdate=2008-03-22 }}</ref> Veloso first heard Gilberto at 17&nbsp;years old, and describes the musician as his "supreme master."<ref name=gross>{{cite news |first=Terry |last=Gross |authorlink=Terry Gross |coauthors=Veloso, Caetano |title=Brazilian Songwriter Caetano Veloso |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=873042 |format=radio |work=[[Fresh Air]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |date=2002-12-10 |accessdate=2008-05-16 }}</ref> He recognizes Gilberto's contribution to Brazilian music as new&mdash;"illuminating" the tradition of Brazilian music and paving the way for future innovation.<ref name=gross/> Veloso moved to the Bahian port city of [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] as a teenager, the city in which Gilberto lived and a center of [[Afro-Brazilian]] culture and music.<ref>Wald (2007), p. 118</ref>

1n 1965 he moved again to [[Rio de Janeiro]], with his sister [[Maria Bethânia]], also a musician. Shortly after the move, Veloso won a [[lyrics]] contest for his composition "Um Dia" and was signed to [[Philips Records]].<ref name=amg/> Beginning in 1967, with collaborators including Bethânia, [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Tom Zé]], and [[Os Mutantes]], Veloso developed Tropicalismo, which fused Brazilian pop with [[rock and roll]] and [[avant-garde]] music. Veloso describes the movement as a wish to be different&mdash;not "defensive" like the right-wing [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|Brazilian military government]], which vehemently opposed the movement. Leftist college students also condemned Tropicalismo because they believed it commercialized Brazilian traditional music by incorporating musical influence from other cultures, specifically the United States.<ref name=gross/> Even though Tropicalismo was controversial among traditional critics, it introduced to [[Música Popular Brasileira]] new elements for making music with an eclectic style.<ref name=schnabel>{{cite book |last=Schnabel |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom Schnabel |title=Rhythm Planet: The Great World Music Makers |year=1998 |publisher=Universe Publishing |location=New York City, New York |isbn=0-7893-0238-1}}</ref>

Veloso studied [[philosophy]] at the [[Universidade Federal da Bahia]],<ref name=manning/> which influenced both his artistic expression and viewpoint on life. Two of his favorite philosophers were [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].<ref name=schnabel/> Veloso's leftist political stance earned him the enmity of Brazil's military dictatorship which ruled until 1985; his songs were frequently censored and some banned.  Veloso and Gil spent several months in prison in 1969 and then were sent into [[exile]]. He said that "they didn't imprison us for any song or any particular thing that we said," ascribing the government's reaction to its unfamiliarity with the cultural phenomenon of Tropicália&mdash;they seemed to say "We might as well put them in prison."<ref>{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Pareles |authorlink=Jon Pareles |title=At Lunch with Caetano Veloso; Lots of Rebellion and a Little Hot Sauce For the Spirited Bob Dylan of Brazil |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDF113FF93AA3575AC0A964958260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=1992-09-09 |accessdate=2008-05-16 }}</ref> The federal police detained the two and flew them to an unknown destination. Finally, Veloso and Gil lived out their exile in London, England. When Caetano was asked about his experience there he says, "London felt dark, and I felt far away from myself." Nevertheless, the two improved their music there and were asked to make a musical production with the producer Ralph Mace.<ref name=schnabel/>

=== Musical career (1972–present) ===
[[Image:Caetano Veloso em Lisboa (2007).jpg|thumb|200px|Veloso performs in [[Lisbon]], Portugal in 2007]]
Veloso's work upon his return in 1972 was often characterized by frequent merging not only of international styles but of Brazilian folkloric styles and rhythms as well. His popularity grew outside Brazil in the 1980s, especially in [[Israel]], Greece, Portugal, France, and Africa. His records released in the United States, such as ''O Estrangeiro'', helped gain him a larger audience.

To celebrate 25&nbsp;years of Tropicalismo, Veloso and Gilberto Gil released a CD called ''Tropicalia 2'' in 1993.<ref name=behague>{{cite journal |last=[[Béhague, Gerard]] |year=2006 |month=Spring/Summer |title=Rap, Reggae, Rock, or Samba: The Local and the Global in Brazilian Popular Music (1985&ndash;95) |journal=Latin American Music Review |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=79&ndash;90 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/latin_american_music_review/v027/27.1behague08.html |doi=10.1353/lat.2006.0021 |first1=Gerard. }}</ref> One song, "Haiti", attracted people's attention during the time, especially because it included powerful statements about sociopolitical issues present in [[Haiti]] and also in Brazil.

In 2002 Veloso published an account of his early years and the Tropicalismo movement, ''Tropical Truth: A Story of Music and Revolution in Brazil''.

His first all-English [[Compact Disc|CD]] was ''A Foreign Sound'' (2004), which covers ''[[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s'' "[[Come As You Are (Nirvana song)|Come as You Are]]" and compositions from the [[Great American Songbook]] such as "[[The Carioca (song)|The Carioca]]" (music by [[Vincent Youmans]] and lyrics by [[Edward Eliscu]] and [[Gus Kahn]]), "[[Always (1925 song)|Always]]" (music and lyrics by [[Irving Berlin]]), "[[Manhattan (song)|Manhattan]]" (music by [[Richard Rodgers]] and lyrics by [[Lorenz Hart]]), "[[Love for Sale (song)|Love for Sale]]" (music and lyrics by [[Cole Porter]]), and "[[Something Good (song)|Something Good]]" (music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers). Six of the seven songs on his third [[eponym]]ous album, released in 1971, were also in English. 

Veloso has contributed songs to two AIDS benefit compilation albums produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]: ''[[Red Hot + Rio]]'' (1996) and ''[[Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon]]'' (1998).

In 2011, he again contributed two songs to the [[Red Hot Organization|Red Hot Organization's]] most recent compilation album, "Red Hot + Rio 2." The two tracks include Terra (Prefuse 73 '3 Mellotrons In A Quiet Room' Version) and Dreamworld: Marco de Canaveses, in collaboration with [[David Byrne]]. 

His September 2006 album, ''[[Cê]]'', was released  by [[Nonesuch Records]] in the United States. It won two [[Latin Grammy Awards]], one for best singer-songwriter<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?cid=726869 |title=Mejor Album Cantautor |accessdate=2008-03-22 |work=[[Univision|Univision.com]] |language=Spanish }}</ref> and one for Best Portuguese Song, "Não Me Arrependo".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?cid=675839 |title=Mejor Cancion Brasileña (Idioma Portugues) |language=Spanish |accessdate=2008-03-22 |work=[[Univision|Univision.com]] }}</ref> With a total of five Latin Grammys, Veloso has received more than any other Brazilian performer.

Veloso has won nine [[Latin Grammy Awards]] and two [[Grammy Awards]]. On November 14, [[Latin Grammy Awards of 2012|2012]], Veloso was honored as the [[Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year]].<ref name="grammy.com"/>

=== Personal life ===
Veloso married fellow Baiana and actress Andrea Gadelha (or Dedé) on November 21, 1967 in a ceremony that reflected the air of the counterculture era. Their son Moreno was born November 22, 1972. On December 13, 1983 their daughter Júlia was born. She died a few days later. Veloso’s father died on December 13, 1983. Veloso separated from Dedé Veloso in 1983. In 1986 Veloso married Rio native Paula Lavigne, with whom he had two more sons, Zeca Lavigne Veloso, born March 7, 1992, and Tom Lavigne Veloso, born January 25, 1997 in Salvador. This marriage lasted twenty years. Although separated since 2004, the two still work together. Veloso’s 1989 CD “Estrangeiro” includes songs (“Esse Amor, which means "That Love” and “Branquinha”) inspired by and dedicated to, respectively, his ex-wife Dedé and his wife at the time, Paula Lavigne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caetanoveloso.com.br/biografia.php |title=Caetano Veloso |publisher=Caetano Veloso |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dicionariompb.com.br/caetano-veloso/biografia |title=Caetano Veloso - Biografia - Dicionário Cravo Albin da Música Popular Brasileira |publisher=Dicionariompb.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gente.ig.com.br/caetanoveloso/#topoBiografia |title=Caetano Veloso: biografia, fotos, vídeos, notícias – iG |publisher=Gente.ig.com.br |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=E.T. himself |url=http://cinema.sapo.pt/pessoa/caetano-veloso/biografia |title=Caetano Veloso - Biografia - Pessoa - SAPO Cinema |publisher=Cinema.sapo.pt |date= |accessdate=2013-04-22}}</ref>

==Musical style==
Veloso's home, Bahia, has had a decisive role in his music. He praises Bahia for its importance in Brazil's colonial period&mdash;when the Portuguese first came&mdash;as well as for Bahia's contribution to Brazilian music.  He has cited among his musical influences [[Amália Rodrigues]], [[Cole Porter]], the [[Rolling Stones]] 1969 tour, and above all, [[João Gilberto]].

Veloso says that he is unable to make a comparison between his musical style in the 1960s, at the height of Tropicália, and his current work. He does note, however, that he has been able to accomplish music of a higher quality later in his career; that he is "better at everything."<ref name=gross/>
