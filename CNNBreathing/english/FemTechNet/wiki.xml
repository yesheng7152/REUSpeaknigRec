<h level="2" i="1">==Description==</h>

At its core, FemTechNet is “an activated network of scholars, artists and students who work on, with, and at the borders of technology, science and feminism in a variety of fields including STS, Media and Visual Studies, Art, Women's, Queer and Ethnic Studies.”<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/the-network/ |title=About FemTechNet |publisher=FemTechNet Commons |accessdate=2013-11-26}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> FTN grew out of a coffee klatch between Balsamo and Juhasz, both of whom have written extensively on women and feminist pedagogy in technology. The pair shared concerns that women's contributions to technology, from academia to art, weren't being recognized, or even documented, and female representation in the field suffered for it.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2012/11/issue1-juhasz/|title=An Idea Whose Time is Here: FemTechNet - A Distributed Online Collaborative Course (DOCC)|author=Juhasz,Alex; Balsamo, Anne|work=Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media and Technology}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

FemTechNet proposed a new model they call a Distributed Open Collaborative Course (DOCC). The DOCC structure eschews centralization for several “nodal” classes that are based around proposed themes and augmented by video discussions available on FemTechNet's website.

<h level="2" i="2">== Theoretical underpinnings ==</h>

FemTechNet articulates its vision in terms of a desire to create &quot;projects of feminist technological innovation for the purposes of engaging the interests of colleagues and students on advanced topics in feminist science-technology studies. This project seeks to engender a set of digital practices among women and girls, to teach and encourage their participation in writing the technocultural histories of the future by becoming active participants in the creation of global digital archives.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|last=Commons|first=FemTechNet|title=About FemTechNet|url=http://femtechnet.newschool.edu/the-network/|accessdate=12 November 2013}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="2" i="3">==Critiques of the DOCC==</h>

One critique of the Distributed Open Collaborative Course is the distribution of knowledge on an open source, without the access to control who comes and goes. &quot;It is a feminist rethinking of the MOOC ([[Massive Open Online Course]]) that has been widely used in distance learning education. A MOOC is pedagogically centralized and branded by a single institution. FemTechNet seeks to enhance the system using feminist principles and methods that support a decentralized, collaborative form of learning.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|title=FAQ for FemTechNet|url=http://fembotcollective.org/femtechnet/faq-for-femtechnet/|publisher=FemTechNet|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>
