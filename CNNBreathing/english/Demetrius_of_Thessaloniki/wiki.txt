:'''''Saint Demetrius''' redirects here. For another saint, see [[Demetrius of Alexandria]]''.

'''Saint Demetrius (or Demetrios) of Thessaloniki''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Άγιος Δημήτριος της Θεσσαλονίκης) was a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[martyr]] who is said to have lived in the [[4th century]]. He is also referred to as "the Megalomartyr" by the [[Greeks]].  The origins of his cult are obscure; the first evidence of its existence comes about 175 years after his martyrdom, and most modern scholars do not believe there was in fact a historical St. Demetrius martyred in Thessaloniki.

Traditional hagiography recounts that Demetrius was a [[deacon]] in [[Thessaloniki]] who was run through with spears in around [[306]] in Thessaloniki, during the Christian persecutions of emperor [[Diocletian]] or [[Galerius]]. Later traditions about Demetrius credit him with a military career in the [[Military history of the Roman Empire|Roman army]], so he is sometimes considered a [[military martyr]]. 

He was extremely popular in the [[Middle Ages]], and along with [[Saint George]], was the patron of the [[Crusades]].

St. Demetrius' relics are kept in [[Thessaloniki]], [[Greece]], a city of which he is the [[patron saint]]. His memory is celebrated on [[26 October]]. He is also revered by the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] as ''Mitar'', having a feast of ''Mitrovdan'' on [[8 November]], which is a [[Public holidays in Bosnia and Herzegovina|public holiday in the Republika Srpska part of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

St. Demetrius is commonly spelled as '''St. Dimitrios''' by Greek immigrants in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].

==Iconography==
[[Image:Relics of Saint Demetrius.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Relics of St. Demetrius at the [[Aghios Demetrios]] Basilica in Thessaloniki.]]St. Demetrius is most commonly depicted in [[icon]]s, [[mosaic]]s and [[fresco]]es wearing the [[armour]] of a [[Roman army |Roman soldier]], although before about 600 AD, he is simply portrayed in robes. After the [[Fall of Constantinople]], St. Demetrius began to be associated with [[St. George]] and together with him was portrayed mounted upon a horse, always a red horse for St. Demetrius and a white one for St. George. [[Equestrianism|Equestrian]] images of the saint can be dated by this depiction.

An additional iconographical convention is to depict Demetrius with the [[White Tower of Thessaloniki]] in the background. The tower depicted in the icons was built in the 16th century, centuries after his life, as the architecture of the older tower in the exact site is unknown.
