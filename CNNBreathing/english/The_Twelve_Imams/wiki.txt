{{Twelve Imams}}
The '''Twelve Imams''' are the spiritual and political successors to [[Muhammad]], the [[Prophet of Islam]], in the [[Twelver]] or ''Ithna Ashariya'' branch of [[Shi'a]] [[Islam]].<ref name="Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia| title=Shi'ite |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica Online | accessdate=2007-11-06 |location=|publisher= |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9067367/Shiite}}</ref>
According to the [[theology of Twelvers]], the successor of [[Muhammad]] is an [[The Fourteen Infallibles|infallible]] human individual who not only rules over the community with justice, but also is able to keep and interpret the [[Shariah|Divine Law]] and its [[Esoteric interpretation of the Qur'an|esoteric meaning]]. The Prophet and Imams' [[Sunnah|words and deeds]] are a guide and model for the community to follow; as a result, they must be free from error and sin, and must be chosen by divine decree, or ''nass'', through the Prophet.<ref>Nasr (1979), p.10</ref><ref>Momen (1985), p.174</ref> 

It is believed in Twelver and [[Ismaili]] Shi'a Islam that [[Aql (Shiasm)|Aql]], a divine wisdom, was the source of the souls of the Prophets and Imams and gave them esoteric knowledge, called Hikmah, and that their sufferings were a means of divine grace to their devotees.<ref>Nasr (1979), p.15</ref><ref>Corbin (1993), pp.45-51</ref><ref name="Britannica"/> Although the Imam was not the recipient of a [[wahy|divine revelation]], he had a close relationship with God, through which God guides him, and the Imam in turn guides the people.  [[Imamate]], or belief in the divine guide is a fundamental belief in the Twelver and Ismaili branches of Shi'a Islam and is based on the concept that God would not leave humanity without access to divine guidance.<ref name="Imamat">{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Encyclopaedia of Islam and the Muslim world; vol.1  | last = Gleave | first = Robert | title=Imamate | publisher = MacMillan | id = ISBN 0028656040}}</ref>

According to Twelvers, there is always an Imam of the Age, who is the divinely appointed authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. [[Ali]] was the first Imam of this line, and in the Twelvers' view, the rightful successor to the Prophet of Islam, followed by male descendants of Muhammad through his daughter [[Fatimah Zahra]].  Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], who was the brother of [[Hasan ibn Ali]].<ref name="Britannica"/> The twelfth and final Imam is [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and [[Major Occultation|hidden till he returns to bring justice to the world]].<ref name="Imamat"/>
