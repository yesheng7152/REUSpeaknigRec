'''Ima Hogg''' (July 10, 1882 – August 19, 1975),<comment>&lt;!-- PLEASE READ WP:MOS; this article does not use autoformatting on dates --&gt;</comment> known as &quot;The First Lady of Texas&quot;,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=FirstLady</attr></ext> was an American [[philanthropy|philanthropist]], patron and collector of the arts, and one of the most respected women in [[Texas]] during the 20th century.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=NYTPhilanthropist</attr></ext> Hogg was an avid art collector, and owned works by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Paul Klee|Klee]], and [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], among others. Hogg donated hundreds of pieces of artwork to Houston's [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston|Museum of Fine Arts]] and served on a committee to plan the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]  An enthusiastic collector of early American antiques, she also served on a committee tasked with locating historical furniture for the [[White House]]. She restored and refurbished several properties, including the [[Varner–Hogg Plantation State Historical Site|Varner plantation]] and [[Bayou Bend Collection and Gardens|Bayou Bend]], which she later donated to Texas arts and historical institutions who maintain the facilities and their collections today. Hogg received numerous awards and honors, including the [[Louise E. du Pont Crowninshield]] Award from the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], the Santa Rita Award from the [[University of Texas System]], and an [[honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] in [[fine art]]s from [[Southwestern University]]. 

Hogg was the daughter of Sarah Ann &quot;Sallie&quot; Stinson and [[Jim Hogg|James Stephen &quot;Big Jim&quot; Hogg]], later [[Attorney General of Texas]] and [[List of Governors of Texas|Governor]] of the state.  Ima Hogg's first name was taken from ''The Fate of Marvin'', an epic poem written by her uncle [[Thomas Elisha Hogg|Thomas Hogg]]. She endeavored to downplay her unusual name by signing her first name illegibly and having her stationery printed with &quot;I. Hogg&quot; or &quot;Miss Hogg&quot;. Although it was rumored that Hogg had a sister named &quot;Ura Hogg&quot;, she had only brothers. Hogg's father left public office in 1895, and soon after, her mother was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]]. When Sarah died later that year, Jim Hogg's widowed elder sister moved to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] to care for the Hogg children. Between 1899 and 1901, Hogg attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]]; she then moved to New York City to study piano and music theory for two years. After her father's death in 1906, she traveled to Europe and spent two years studying music under [[Xaver Scharwenka]] in [[Vienna]]. When she returned to Texas, she established and managed the [[Houston Symphony|Houston Symphony Orchestra]] and served as president of the Symphony Society. 

The discovery of [[Petroleum|oil]] on her family's [[plantation]] made Hogg very wealthy, and she used this income to benefit the people of Texas. In 1929, she founded the Houston Child Guidance Center, which provides counseling for disturbed children and their families. Through her brother's will, she established the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health at the University of Texas at Austin in 1940. Hogg successfully ran for a seat on the [[Houston Independent School District|Houston School Board]] in 1943, where she worked to remove gender and race as criteria for determining pay and established art education programs for black students. Hogg never married, and died in 1975. The Ima Hogg Foundation was the major beneficiary of her will, and carries on her philanthropic work today. Several annual awards have been established in her name, honoring her efforts to preserve cultural heritage in Texas.

Ima Hogg later recounted that &quot;my grandfather Stinson lived fifteen miles [24&amp;nbsp;km] from Mineola and news traveled slowly. When he learned of his granddaughter's name he came trotting to town as fast as he could to protest but it was too late. The christening had taken place, and Ima I was to remain.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard18</attr></ext>  During her childhood, Hogg's elder brother William often came home from school with a bloody nose, the result of defending, as she later recalled, &quot;my good name&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard19</attr><inner>Bernhard (1984), p. 19.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  Throughout her adult years, Hogg signed her name in a scrawl that left her first name illegible.  Her personal stationery was usually printed &quot;Miss Hogg&quot; or &quot;I. Hogg&quot;, and she often had her stationery order placed in her secretary's name to avoid questions.  Hogg did not use a nickname until several months before her death, when she began calling herself &quot;Imogene&quot;.

In the early 1930s, Hogg worked on a collection of her father's papers and speeches with his biographer, historian Robert C. Cotner; she became a guardian of his place in history, often writing to clarify or refute articles published about her father.  According to Bernhard, &quot;the very fact that Ima had been burdened with a name that made a lifetime of explanations necessary also made her anxious to defend her father from all detractors. By doing so, she defended herself as well, and she did so with considerable skill and unfailing politeness.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard89</attr><inner>Bernhard (1984), p. 89.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="2" i="2">==Early years==</h>
Ima Hogg was born in [[Mineola, Texas|Mineola]], [[Texas]] in 1882 to [[Jim Hogg]] and Sarah Ann &quot;Sallie&quot; Stinson.  She was the second of four children, including brothers William Clifford Hogg (1875–1930), Michael Hogg (1885–1941), and Thomas Elisha Hogg (1887–1949).<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=hendrickson</attr><inner>Hendrickson (1995), p. 130.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  The Hogg family had long been active in public service. Her great-grandfather, Thomas Hogg, served in the state legislatures of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], and [[Mississippi]]. Her grandfather, Joseph Lewis Hogg, served in the [[Congress of the Republic of Texas]] and helped to write the [[Texas Constitution|Texas State Constitution]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard20</attr><inner>Bernhard (1994), p. 20.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  At the time of her birth, Hogg's father was the district attorney of the Seventh District in Texas.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard24</attr></ext> His term expired in 1884, and the family moved to [[Tyler, Texas|Tyler]], where he practiced law.

Hogg and her younger brothers were rambunctious. She recalled that they particularly enjoyed sliding down the banisters in the Governor's Mansion. Hogg's parents allowed this to continue until Thomas cut his chin, after which Jim Hogg nailed tacks along the center of the railing to curb the activity through fear of bloodied posteriors; the holes from the tacks remained visible in the banister for many decades after the Hogg family moved from the home.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard25</attr></ext> Hogg's mother attempted to teach her ladylike skills such as needlework, but Hogg claimed that she &quot;never had the patience to succeed&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard25</attr></ext>  Her mother also encouraged Hogg to learn [[German language|German]].

The two were scheduled to sail to Seattle, but Hogg refused to board the ship.

Hogg joined her elder brother William on a vacation in Germany in 1930.  During their visit, he suffered a gallbladder attack and died on September 12, 1930 after emergency surgery. Ima brought her brother's body back to the United States.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=neely71</attr></ext>  His will bequeathed $2.5&amp;nbsp;million to UT; his desire was that it be used alongside money donated by his sister for &quot;far-reaching benefit to the people of Texas&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Kelley&quot;</attr></ext> Legal challenges tied up the grant until 1939, when the University received $1.8&amp;nbsp;million.

<h level="3" i="5">===Furniture and art collector===</h>
Hogg and her brothers were avid art collectors; she owned a large collection, including [[Native_Americans_in_the_United_States#Society_and_art|Native American art]] and works by [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]], [[Marc Chagall|Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]] and [[Amedeo Modigliani|Modigliani]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=NYTDame</attr></ext>  Her interest in collecting began during her convalescence in Philadelphia.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard62</attr><inner>Bernhard (1984), p. 62.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  Her first purchase, in 1922, was a Spanish foot chair or [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]] maple chair with carved feet.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard63</attr><inner>Bernhard (1984), p. 63.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard104</attr><inner>Bernhard (1984), p. 104.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  She researched the early American furniture market extensively, personally visiting [[Luke Vincent Lockwood]], the author of the standard work on the topic, for more information.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard104</attr></ext>  At the time, Hogg was one of a small number of people who believed that American antiques had value—by contrast, most collectors concentrated on furniture built in Europe.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard101</attr><inner>Bernhard (1984), p. 101.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Other collectors soon saw the value in early American pieces.  Hogg remained one of the few collectors not located on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].  As her collection grew, she was often asked to loan pieces for exhibit in [[New England]]; Hogg always refused, stating &quot;they've got plenty of these things up there&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name = bernhard9</attr></ext>

<h level="2" i="7">==Description and disposition==</h>
David Warren, the first curator of Bayou Bend, said Hogg was &quot;small and dainty and feminine—and smart and sharp and knowledgeable—all rolled into one&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard14</attr><inner>Bernhard (1984), p. 14.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>
Her biographer Bernhard described her as &quot;elegantly and stylishly dressed&quot;, 5&amp;nbsp;feet 2&amp;nbsp;inches (157&amp;nbsp;cm) tall and of fair complexion,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard7</attr><inner>Bernhard (1984), p. 7.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> &quot;independent and self-possessed&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard58</attr></ext> and noted that she could &quot;sugarcoat her single-mindedness with layers of charm&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard12</attr><inner>Bernhard (1984) p. 12.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  At the age of 81, she was described by ''The New York Times'' as a &quot;blue-eyed strawberry blonde&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=NYTDame</attr><inner>{{Cite news | last = Curtis  | first =  Charlotte | title = A Grande Dame Comes Here From Texas to Promote Culture | work = The New York Times | page = 32 | date = March 4, 1964}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

One morning in 1914,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard58</attr></ext> Hogg was awakened by a burglar in her bedroom. She confronted the man, who was attempting to steal her jewelry, and not only convinced him to return the jewelry, but &quot;wrote down a name and address, handed it to him and told him to go there that very day to get a job&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=iscoe17</attr></ext>  When asked why she did that, Hogg responded, &quot;He didn't look like a bad man.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=iscoe17</attr><inner>Iscoe (1976), p. 17.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  Later that year, she sailed to Germany, alone.  While she was en route, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] was assassinated, and the day before she arrived, England declared war on Germany. The United States was still neutral, however, so Hogg continued her tour of Europe, not leaving until several months later.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard58</attr><inner>Bernhard (1984), p. 58.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Though Bernard describes Hogg as a woman of &quot;unfailing politeness&quot;,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=bernhard89</attr></ext> the biographer suggests the philanthropist was not without adversaries. For instance, at a concert arranged by the Houston Symphony for her 90th birthday featuring the elderly pianist [[Arthur Rubinstein]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=winegarten</attr></ext> he characterized her as a &quot;tiresome old woman&quot;. Hogg, in turn, regarded the musician as &quot;a pompous old man&quot;. By contrast, Hogg said of [[Vladimir Horowitz]], whom she met backstage at a 1975 concert in Houston, &quot;Such a nice man. Not at all like that Mr. Rubinstein.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Bernhard (1984), pp. 5–6.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Hogg was a generous benefactor, and believed that &quot;inherited money was a public trust&quot;.  She was described by the [[University of Houston]] as &quot;compassionate by nature&quot;, &quot;progressive in outlook&quot;, &quot;concerned with the welfare of all Texans&quot;, a &quot;zealous proponent of mental health care&quot; and &quot;committed to public education&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=uhcoe</attr><inner>{{cite web| url = http://www.fm.coe.uh.edu/comparisons/ima3a.html|title =
