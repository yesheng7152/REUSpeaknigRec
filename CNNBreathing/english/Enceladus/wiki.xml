''Voyager 1'' found that Enceladus orbited in the densest part of Saturn's diffuse [[Rings of Saturn#E Ring|E ring]], indicating a possible association between the two, while ''Voyager 2'' revealed that despite the moon's small size, it had a wide range of terrains ranging from old, heavily [[impact crater|cratered]] surfaces to young, tectonically deformed [[terrain]], with some regions with surface ages as young as 100 [[million]] years old.

In 2005 the ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'' spacecraft performed several close flybys of Enceladus, revealing the moon's surface and environment in greater detail. In particular, the probe discovered a water-rich plume venting from the moon's south [[polar region]]. This discovery, along with the presence of escaping [[internal heat]] and very few (if any) impact craters in the south polar region, shows that Enceladus is geologically active today. Moons in the extensive satellite systems of gas giants often become trapped in [[orbital resonance]]s that lead to forced [[libration]] or [[orbital eccentricity]]; proximity to the planet can then lead to [[tidal heating]] of the satellite's interior, offering a possible explanation for the activity.

Enceladus is one of only three [[Solar system#Outer planets|outer solar system]] bodies (along with [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]] and [[Neptune]]'s moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]]) where active eruptions have been observed. Analysis of the outgassing suggests that it originates from a body of sub-surface liquid [[water]], which along with the unique chemistry found in the plume, has fueled speculations that Enceladus may be important in the study of [[astrobiology]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Ciclops1881</attr><inner>[http://ciclops.org/view.php?id=1881 ''Cassini Images of Enceladus Suggest Geysers Erupt Liquid Water at the Moon’s South Pole''].

Enceladus is named after the [[Gigantes|Giant]] [[Enceladus (mythology)|Enceladus]] of [[Greek mythology]].

Like many Saturnian satellites discovered prior to the [[Space Age]], Enceladus was first observed during a Saturnian equinox, when Earth is within the ring plane; at such times, the reduction in glare from the rings makes the moons easier to observe.

Prior to the [[Voyager program|Voyager missions]] the view of Enceladus improved little from the dot first observed by Herschel. Only its orbital characteristics were known, with estimations of its [[mass]], [[density]] and [[albedo]].

The two [[Voyager program|Voyager]] spacecraft obtained the first close-up images of Enceladus. ''[[Voyager 1]]'' was the first to fly past Enceladus, at a distance of 202,000&amp;nbsp;km on November 12, 1980.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Voyager</attr><inner>[http://pds-rings.seti.org/voyager/mission/ ''Voyager Mission Description''].

The geologically youthful terrains came as a great surprise to the scientific community, because no theory was then able to predict that such a small (and cold, compared to [[Jupiter]]'s highly active moon [[Io (moon)|Io]]) celestial body could bear signs of such activity. However, ''Voyager 2'' failed to determine whether Enceladus was currently active or whether it was the source of the E-ring.

The answer to these and other mysteries would have to wait until the arrival of the [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'' spacecraft]] on July 1, 2004, when it went into orbit around Saturn. Given the results from the ''Voyager 2'' images, Enceladus was considered a priority target by the ''Cassini'' mission planners, and several targeted [[Planetary flyby|flyby]]s within 1,500&amp;nbsp;km of the surface were planned as well as numerous, &quot;non-targeted&quot; opportunities within 100,000&amp;nbsp;km of Enceladus. These encounters are listed at right. So far, four close flybys of Enceladus have been performed, yielding significant information concerning Enceladus's surface, as well as the discovery of [[water vapor]] and complex [[hydrocarbon]]s venting from the geologically active South Polar Region. These discoveries have prompted the adjustment of Cassini's flight plan to allow closer flybys of Enceladus, including an encounter in March 2008 which took the probe to within 52&amp;nbsp;km of the moon's surface.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=PlanetarySocTable</attr></ext> The extended mission for Cassini included seven close flybys of Enceladus between July 2008 and July 2010, including two passes at only 50&amp;nbsp;km in the later half of 2008.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=SpaceDaily02052007</attr><inner>Moomaw, B.; [http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Tour_de_Saturn_Set_For_Extended_Play_999.html ''Tour de Saturn Set For Extended Play''], Spacedaily.com, February 5, 2007.

<h level="3" i="4">===Orbit===</h>
[[File:Enceladus orbit 2.jpg|thumb|Figure 2: View of Enceladus's orbit (highlighted in red) from above Saturn's north pole]]
Enceladus is one of the major inner satellites of Saturn. It is the fourteenth satellite when ordered by distance from Saturn, and orbits within the densest part of the [[Rings of Saturn#E Ring|E Ring]], the outermost of [[rings of Saturn|Saturn's rings]], an extremely wide but very diffuse disk of microscopic icy or dusty material, beginning at the orbit of [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] and ending somewhere around the orbit of [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]].

Enceladus orbits Saturn at a distance of 238,000&amp;nbsp;km from the planet's center and 180,000&amp;nbsp;km from its cloudtops, between the orbits of [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] and [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], requiring 32.9 hours to revolve once (fast enough for its motion to be observed over a single night of observation). Enceladus is currently in a 2:1 mean motion [[orbital resonance]] with [[Dione (moon)|Dione]], completing two orbits of Saturn for every one orbit completed by Dione. This resonance helps maintain Enceladus's orbital eccentricity (0.0047) and provides a heating source for Enceladus's geologic activity.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Porco</attr></ext>

Like most of the larger satellites of Saturn, Enceladus rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face pointed toward Saturn. Unlike the Earth's moon, Enceladus does not appear to [[libration|librate]] about its spin axis (more than 1.5°). However, analysis of the shape of Enceladus suggests that at some point it was in a 1:4 forced secondary spin-orbit libration.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Porco</attr></ext> This libration, like the resonance with Dione, could have provided Enceladus with an additional heat source.

<h level="4" i="5">====Interaction with E Ring====</h>
The [[Rings of Saturn#E Ring|E Ring]] is the widest and outermost ring of Saturn. It is an extremely wide but very diffuse disk of microscopic icy or dusty material, beginning at the orbit of [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] and ending somewhere around the orbit of [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]], though some observations suggest that it extends beyond the orbit of Titan, making it 1,000,000&amp;nbsp;km wide. However, numerous mathematical models show that such a ring is unstable, with a lifespan between 10,000 and 1,000,000 years. Therefore, particles composing it must be constantly replenished. Enceladus is orbiting inside this ring, in a place where it is narrowest but present in its highest density. Therefore, several theories suspected Enceladus to be the main source of particles for the E Ring. This hypothesis was supported by Cassini's flyby.

The second mechanism comes from meteoric bombardment of Enceladus, raising dust particles from the surface.

''[[Voyager 2]]'', in August 1981, was the first spacecraft to observe the surface in detail. Examination of the resulting highest resolution [[mosaic]] reveals at least five different types of terrain, including several regions of cratered terrain, regions of smooth (young) terrain, and lanes of ridged terrain often bordering the smooth areas.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Rothery</attr></ext> In addition, extensive linear cracks<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;cracks&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite news|last=NASA|title=Cracks on Enceladus Open and Close under Saturn's Pull|date=2007-05-16|url =http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/enceladus_cracks.html}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> and [[escarpment|scarps]] were observed. Given the relative lack of craters on the smooth plains, these regions are probably less than a few hundred million years old. Accordingly, Enceladus must have been recently active with &quot;[[cryovolcanism|water volcanism]]&quot; or other processes that renew the surface. The fresh, clean ice that dominates its surface gives Enceladus probably the most reflective surface of any body in the solar system with a [[geometric albedo|visual geometric albedo]] of 1.38.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Verbiscer</attr></ext> Because it reflects so much sunlight, the mean surface temperature at noon only reaches −198&amp;nbsp;°C (somewhat colder than other Saturnian satellites).<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Spencer</attr></ext>

Observations during three flybys by ''Cassini'' on February 17, March 9, and July 14 of 2005 revealed Enceladus's surface features in much greater detail than the ''Voyager 2'' observations. For example, the smooth plains observed by ''Voyager 2'' resolved into relatively crater-free regions filled with numerous small [[ridge]]s and scarps. In addition, numerous fractures were found within the older, cratered terrain, suggesting that the surface has been subjected to extensive deformation since the craters were formed.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Rathbun</attr><inner>Rathbun, J.

[[Impact crater]]ing is a common occurrence on many solar system bodies. Much of Enceladus's surface is covered with craters at various densities and levels of degradation. From ''Voyager 2'' observations, three different [[Geologic unit|units]] of cratered topography were identified on the basis of their crater densities, from ct&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ct&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, both containing numerous 10–20&amp;nbsp;km-wide craters though differing in the degree of deformation, to cp consisting of lightly cratered plains.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Smith</attr><inner>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.215.4532.504|title=A New Look at the Saturn System: The Voyager 2 Images|year=1982|author=Smith, B.

Recent ''Cassini'' observations have provided a much closer look at the ct&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and cp cratered units. These high-resolution observations, like Figure 6, reveal that many of Enceladus's craters are heavily deformed through viscous relaxation and [[fracture|fracturing]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Turtle</attr><inner>Turtle, E. P.; ''et al.''; [http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/products/pdfs/CHARM_Turtle_050426.pdf ''Enceladus, Curiouser and Curiouser: Observations by Cassini's Imaging Science Subsystem''], Cassini CHARM Teleconference, 28 April 2005</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Viscous relaxation allows gravity, over geologic time scales, to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice, reducing the amount of topography over time. The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice: warmer ice is easier to deform than colder, stiffer ice. Viscously relaxed craters tend to have [[dome]]d floors, or are recognized as craters only by a raised, circular rim (seen at center just below the [[terminator (solar)|terminator]] in Figure 6). [[Dunyazad (crater)|Dunyazad]], the large crater seen in Figure 8 just left of top center, is a prime example of a viscously relaxed crater on Enceladus, with a prominent domed floor. In addition, many craters on Enceladus have been heavily modified by tectonic fractures. The 10-km-wide crater right of bottom center in Figure 8 is a prime example: thin fractures, several hundred meters to a kilometer wide, have heavily altered the crater's rim and floor. Nearly all craters on Enceladus thus far imaged by ''Cassini'' in the ct&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; unit show signs of tectonic deformation. These two deformation styles—viscous relaxation and fracturing—demonstrate that, while cratered terrains are the oldest regions on Enceladus because of their high crater retention, nearly all craters on Enceladus are in some stage of degradation.

<h level="4" i="9">====Tectonics====</h>
''Voyager 2'' found several types of tectonic features on Enceladus, including [[trough (geology)|troughs]], scarps, and [[Geology|belts]] of grooves and [[ridge]]s.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Rothery</attr></ext> Recent results from ''Cassini'' suggest that [[tectonism]] is the dominant deformation style on Enceladus. One of the more dramatic types of tectonic features found on Enceladus are rifts. These canyons can be up to 200&amp;nbsp;km long, 5–10&amp;nbsp;km wide, and one km deep. Figure 7 shows a typical large fracture on Enceladus cutting across older, tectonically deformed terrain. Another example can be seen running along the bottom of the frame in Figure 8. Such features appear relatively young, as they cut across other tectonic features and have sharp topographic relief with prominent outcrops along the cliff faces.

Another example of tectonism on Enceladus is grooved terrain, consisting of lanes of curvilinear grooves and ridges. These bands, first discovered by ''Voyager 2'', often separate smooth plains from cratered regions.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Rothery</attr></ext> An example of this terrain type can be seen in Figures 6 and 10 (in this case, a feature known as [[Samarkand Sulci]]). Grooved terrains such as Samarkand Sulci are reminiscent of grooved terrain on [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]]. However, unlike those seen on Ganymede, grooved topography on Enceladus is generally much more complex. Rather than parallel sets of grooves, these lanes can often appear as bands of crudely aligned, chevron-shaped features. In other areas, these bands appear to bow upwards with fractures and ridges running the length of the feature. ''Cassini'' observations of Samarkand Sulci have revealed intriguing dark spots (125 and 750 m wide), which appear to run parallel to narrow fractures. Currently, these spots are interpreted as collapse pits within these ridged plain belts.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Turtle</attr></ext>

[[File:EN004 Moon with a Past.jpg|thumb|Figure 9: High-resolution mosaic of Enceladus's surface, showing several tectonic and crater degradation styles. Taken by ''Cassini'' on 9 March 2005.]]

In addition to deep fractures and grooved lanes, Enceladus has several other types of tectonic terrain. Figure 9 shows sets of narrow fractures (still several hundred meters wide) that were first discovered by the ''Cassini'' spacecraft. Many of these fractures are found in bands cutting across cratered terrain. These fractures appear to propagate down only a few hundred meters into the crust. Many appear to have been influenced during their formation by the weakened [[regolith]] produced by impact craters, often changing the strike of the propagating fracture.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Turtle</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Barnash</attr><inner>Barnash, A.

Examples of linear grooves can be found in the lower left of the figure at top and Figure 10 (lower left), running from north to south from top center before turning to the southwest. These linear grooves can be seen cutting across other terrain types, like the groove and ridge belts. Like the deep rifts, they appear to be among the youngest features on Enceladus. However, some linear grooves appear to be softened like the craters nearby, suggesting an older age. Ridges have also been observed on Enceladus, though not nearly to the extent as those seen on [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]. Several examples can be seen in the lower left corner of Figure 7. These ridges are relatively limited in extent and are up to one km tall. One-kilometer high domes have also been observed.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Turtle</attr></ext> Given the level of tectonic resurfacing found on Enceladus, it is clear that tectonism has been an important driver of geology on this small moon for much of its history.

Two units of smooth plains were also observed by ''Voyager 2''.

''Cassini'' images show smooth plain regions to be filled with low-relief ridges and fractures. These features are currently interpreted as being caused by [[shear stress|shear deformation]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Turtle</attr></ext> The high resolution images of Sarandib Planitia have revealed a number of small impact craters, which allow for an estimate of the surface age, either 170 million years or 3.7 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years, depending on assumed impactor population.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Porco</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Crater_flux</attr><inner>Without samples to provide absolute age determinations, crater counting is currently the only method for determining surface age on most planetary surfaces.

The expanded surface coverage provided by ''Cassini'' has allowed for the identification of additional regions of smooth plains, particularly on Enceladus's leading hemisphere (the side of Enceladus that faces the direction of motion as the moon orbits Saturn). Rather than being covered in low relief ridges, this region is covered in numerous criss-crossing sets of troughs and ridges, similar to the deformation seen in the south polar region.

[[File:Enceladus south pole SE15.png|thumb|upright|Composite map of the south polar region (to 65 deg. S. latitude) of Enceladus (2007)]]
The boundary of the south polar region is marked by a pattern of parallel, Y- and V-shaped ridges and valleys. The shape, orientation, and location of these features indicate that they are caused by changes in the overall shape of Enceladus. <template><title>As of</title><part><name index="1"/><value>2006</value></part><part><name>alt</name><equals>=</equals><value>Currently</value></part></template>, there are two theories for what could cause such a shift in shape. First, the orbit of Enceladus may have migrated inward (from the article: &quot;the lack of any plausible mechanism for increased flattening&quot;), leading to an increase in Enceladus's rotation rate. Such a shift would have led to a flattening of Enceladus's rotation axis.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Porco</attr></ext> Another theory suggests that a rising mass of warm, low density material in Enceladus's interior led to a shift in the position of the current south polar terrain from Enceladus's southern mid-latitudes to its south pole.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Pappalardo</attr></ext> Consequently, the ellipsoid shape of Enceladus would have adjusted to match the new orientation. One consequence of the axial flattening theory is that both polar regions should have similar tectonic deformation histories.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Porco</attr></ext> However, the north polar region is densely cratered, and has a much older surface age than the south pole.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Smith</attr></ext> Thickness variations in Enceladus's [[lithosphere]] is one explanation for this discrepancy. Variations in lithospheric thickness are supported by the correlation between the Y-shaped discontinuities and the V-shaped cusps along the south polar terrain margin and the relative surface age of the adjacent non-south polar terrain regions. The Y-shaped discontinuities, and the north-south trending tension fractures into which they lead, are correlated with younger terrain with presumably thinner lithospheres. The V-shaped cusps are adjacent to older, more heavily cratered terrains.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Porco</attr></ext>

Following the ''Voyager'' encounters with Enceladus in the early 1980s, scientists postulated that the moon may be geologically active based on its young, reflective surface and location near the core of the E ring.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Rothery</attr></ext> Based on the connection between Enceladus and the E ring, it was thought that Enceladus was the source of material in the E ring, perhaps through venting of water vapor from Enceladus's interior. However, the Voyagers failed to provide conclusive evidence that Enceladus is active today.

Thanks to data from a number of instruments on the Cassini spacecraft in 2005, [[cryovolcanism]], where water and other volatiles are the materials erupted instead of silicate rock, has been discovered on Enceladus. The first Cassini sighting of a plume of icy particles above Enceladus's south pole came from the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) images taken in January and February 2005,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Porco</attr></ext> though the possibility of the plume being a camera artifact stalled an official announcement. Data from the [[magnetometer]] instrument during the February 17, 2005 encounter provided a hint that the feature might be real when it found evidence for an atmosphere at Enceladus. The magnetometer observed an increase in the power of [[Electrostatic ion cyclotron wave|ion cyclotron waves]] near Enceladus. These waves are produced by the interaction of ionized particles and magnetic fields, and the frequency of the waves can be used to identify the composition, in this case [[ion]]ized [[water vapor]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Dougherty</attr></ext> During the next two encounters, the [[magnetometer]] team determined that gases in Enceladus's atmosphere are concentrated over the south polar region, with atmospheric density away from the pole being much lower.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Dougherty</attr></ext> The [[Ultraviolet]] Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) confirmed this result by observing two [[occultation|stellar occultations]] during the February 17 and July 14 encounters. Unlike the magnetometer, UVIS failed to detect an atmosphere above Enceladus during the February encounter when it looked for evidence for an atmosphere over the equatorial region, but did detect water vapor during an occultation over the south polar region during the July encounter.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Hansen</attr></ext>

Fortuitously, Cassini flew through this gas cloud during the July 14 encounter, allowing instruments like the Ion and Neutral [[Mass spectrometry|Mass Spectrometer]] ([[INMS]]) and the cosmic dust analyzer (CDA) to directly sample the plume. INMS measured the composition of the gas cloud, detecting mostly water vapor, as well as minor components like molecular [[nitrogen]], [[methane]], and [[carbon dioxide]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Waite</attr></ext> CDA &quot;detected a large increase in the number of particles near Enceladus,&quot; confirming the satellite as the primary source for the E ring.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Spahn</attr></ext> Analysis of the CDA and INMS data suggest that the gas cloud ''Cassini'' flew through during the July encounter, and observed from a distance with its magnetometer and UVIS, was actually a water-rich cryovolcanic plume, originating from vents near the south pole.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=JPL619</attr><inner>[http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/press-release-details.cfm?newsID=619 ''NASA's Cassini Images Reveal Spectacular Evidence of an Active Moon''], 6 December 2005.

Visual confirmation of venting came in November 2005, when ISS imaged [[geyser]]-like [[Plume (hydrodynamics)|jets]] of icy particles rising from the moon's south polar region.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Porco</attr></ext> (As stated above, the plume was imaged before, in January and February 2005, but additional studies of the camera's response at high phase angles, when the sun is almost behind Enceladus, and comparison with equivalent high phase images taken of other Saturnian satellites, were required before this could be confirmed.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Ciclops1652</attr><inner>[http://ciclops.org/view.php?id=1652 ''Spray Above Enceladus''].

[[File:Enceladus Cold Geyser Model.svg|thumb|350px|Figure 14: One possible scheme for Enceladus's cryovolcanism]]
The combined analysis of imaging, mass spectrometry, and magnetospheric data suggests that the observed south polar plume emanates from pressurized sub-surface chambers, similar to [[geyser]]s on Earth.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Porco</attr></ext> Because no [[ammonia]] was found in the vented material by INMS or UVIS, which could act as an anti-freeze, such a heated, pressurized chamber would consist of nearly pure liquid water with a temperature of at least <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>270</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>K</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>°C</value></part><part><name>abbr</name><equals>=</equals><value>on</value></part></template>, as illustrated in Figure 14. Pure water would require more energy to melt, either from tidal or radiogenic sources, than an ammonia-water mixture. Another possible method for generating a plume is [[sublimation (physics)|sublimation]] of warm surface ice. During the July 14, 2005 flyby, the Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) found a warm region near the South Pole. Temperatures found in this region range from 85–90 K, to small areas with temperatures as high as <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>157</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>K</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>°C</value></part><part><name>abbr</name><equals>=</equals><value>on</value></part></template>, much too warm to be explained by solar heating, indicating that parts of the south polar region are heated from the interior of Enceladus.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Spencer</attr></ext> Ice at these temperatures is warm enough to sublimate at a much faster rate than the background surface, thus generating a plume. This hypothesis is attractive since the sub-surface layer heating the surface water ice could be an ammonia-water slurry at temperatures as low as <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>170</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>K</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>°C</value></part><part><name>abbr</name><equals>=</equals><value>on</value></part></template>, and thus not as much energy is required to produce the plume activity. However, the abundance of particles in the south polar plume favors the &quot;cold geyser&quot; model, as opposed to an ice sublimation model.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Porco</attr></ext>

Alternatively, Kieffer ''et al.'' (2006) suggest that Enceladus's geysers originate from [[clathrate]] hydrates, where carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen are released when exposed to the vacuum of space by the active, tiger stripe fractures.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Kieffer2006</attr><inner>{{cite journal| first=Susan W.| last= Kieffer| coauthors= Lu, Xinli; Bethke, Craig M.; Spencer, John R.; Marshak, Stephen; and Navrotsky, Alexandra| year=2006| doi=10.1126/science.1133519| title=A Clathrate Reservoir Hypothesis for Enceladus's South Polar Plume| journal=Science| volume=314| issue=5806| pages=1764–1766| pmid=17170301|bibcode = 2006Sci...314.1764K }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> This hypothesis would not require the amount of heat needed to melt water ice as required by the &quot;Cold Geyser&quot; model, and would explain the lack of ammonia.

Prior to the [[Cassini–Huygens|''Cassini'']] mission, relatively little was known about the interior of Enceladus. However, results from recent flybys of Enceladus by the ''Cassini'' spacecraft have provided much needed information for models of Enceladus's interior. These include a better determination of the mass and tri-axial ellipsoid shape, high-resolution observations of the surface, and new insights on Enceladus's [[geochemistry]].

Mass estimates from the [[Voyager program]] missions suggested that Enceladus was composed almost entirely of water ice.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Rothery</attr></ext> However, based on the effects of Enceladus's [[gravity]] on ''Cassini'', its mass was determined to be much higher than previously thought, yielding a density of 1.61 [[gram|g]]/cm³.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Porco</attr></ext> This density is higher than Saturn's other mid-sized icy satellites, indicating that Enceladus contains a greater percentage of [[silicate]]s and [[iron]]. With additional material besides water ice, Enceladus's interior may have experienced comparatively more heating from the [[radioactive decay|decay]] of radioactive elements.

Castillo ''et al.'' 2005 suggested that [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]], and the other icy satellites of Saturn, formed relatively quickly after the formation of the Saturnian sub-nebula, and thus were rich in short-lived radionuclides.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Castillo1</attr><inner>Castillo, J.

In addition to its mass and modeled [[geochemistry]], researchers have also examined Enceladus's shape to test whether the satellite is differentiated or not.

Eventually it was discovered that  in the E-ring about 6% of particles contain 0.5–2% of sodium salts by mass, which is a significant amount.
