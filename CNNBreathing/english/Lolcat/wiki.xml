Another common lolcat displays a cat with a specific look, which is described by ''adjective'', and the text, &quot;[adjective] cat is [adjective]&quot;, &quot;[adjective] cat is not [adjective]&quot; or &quot;Your offering pleases [adjective] cat.&quot; A version of this is also stated as &quot;''adjective'' cat is not amused&quot;, or &quot;[adjective] cat has run out of [adjective]&quot; (when the cat in related picture seems to be feeling the opposite of the adjective used to describe it.)

More of these themes are springing up every day. One theme is some variation on &quot;''noun''... We/I ''verb'' them/it&quot;.
Another follows the rough format of &quot;''activity''... you're doing it right/wrong&quot;. Another is &quot;''activity''... brb [be right back]&quot;.

There are several well-known lolcat images and single-word captions that have spawned many variations and imitations, like &quot;Ceiling Cat&quot;, &quot;I can has Cheezburger,&quot; &quot;monorail cat&quot;, &quot;I made you a cookie/but I eated it&quot;, &quot;hover cat&quot;, &quot;Oh Hai I upgraded your RAM,&quot; &quot;WANT&quot;, &quot;DO NOT WANT!,&quot; &quot;Fail&quot;,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article3304328.ece Microtrends: Failure - Times Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> &quot;NOM NOM NOM&quot;, &quot;Halp!&quot;, and &quot;Proceed.&quot;   References to walruses (LOLRUSes) and buckets (bukkits) are occasionally made.
