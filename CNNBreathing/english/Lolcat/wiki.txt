A '''Lolcat''', or '''LOLCAT''', is an image combining a [[photograph]] of an animal, most frequently a [[cat]], with a [[humorous]] and [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] [[caption]] in (often) broken English&#8212;a dialect which is known as "Kitty Pidgin",<ref name="kitty pidgin" /> "lolspeak", or Lolcat. The name "lolcat" is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound word]]<!-- note: not a portmanteau --> of "[[LOL]]" and "cat".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radioopensource.org/i-can-has-talking-animals/ |title=I Can Has Talking Animals? |author=Robin Amer |date=[[2007-04-14]] |accessdate=2007-04-29 |work=[[Open Source (radio show)|Open Source]]}}</ref><ref name="Silverman">{{cite web

}} Partial scan of the print edition: http://fcrunk.wellimean.com/memes/catstime.jpg</ref> which wrote that non-commercialized [[phenomenon|phenomena]] of the sort are increasingly rare, stating that lolcats have "a distinctly old-school, early 1990s, [[Usenet]] feel to [them]." The superimposed text is assumed to be uttered by the cat in the photograph. There are parallels between the language used in lolcats and baby talk, which owners of cats often use when talking to them.

These images usually consist of a photo of a cat with a large caption characteristically formatted in an uppercase [[sans serif]] font such as [[Impact (typeface)|Impact]] or [[Arial Black]].<ref name="cats has grammar">{{cite web|url=http://www.dashes.com/anil/2007/04/23/cats_can_has_gr|title=Anil Dash: Cats Can Has Grammar|author=[[Anil Dash]]|date=[[2007-04-23]]|accessdate=2007-05-03}}</ref> The image is, on occasion, [[Photo editing|digitally edited]] for effect. The caption generally acts as a [[speech balloon]] encompassing a comment from the cat, or as a description of the depicted scene. The caption is intentionally written with deviations from standard English spelling and syntax,<ref name= "cats has grammar" /> featuring "strangely-conjugated verbs, but [a tendency] to converge to a new set of rules in spelling and grammar."<ref name="Newitz 2007">{{cite web

"I has a ''noun''" pictures show a cat in possession of an object while "Invisible ''noun''" show pictures of cats apparently interacting with said invisible object.<ref name="tampa" /> The related "flavor" shots specifically show a cat (or another animal) licking/eating an item, person or animal (including sometimes themselves) and remarking how "[noun] haz a flavor."<ref name="flavor">{{cite web

}}</ref> "My ''noun'', let me show you it/them" pictures are accompanied by cats apparently presenting or offering an object. Another common lolcat displays a cat with a specific look, which is described by ''adjective'', and the text, "[adjective] cat is [adjective]", "[adjective] cat is not [adjective]" or "Your offering pleases [adjective] cat." A version of this is also stated as "''adjective'' cat is not amused", or "[adjective] cat has run out of [adjective]" (when the cat in related picture seems to be feeling the opposite of the adjective used to describe it.)

More of these themes are springing up every day. One theme is some variation on "''noun''... We/I ''verb'' them/it".
Another follows the rough format of "''activity''... you're doing it right/wrong". Another is "''activity''... brb [be right back]".

There are several well-known lolcat images and single-word captions that have spawned many variations and imitations, like "Ceiling Cat", "I can has Cheezburger," "monorail cat", "I made you a cookie/but I eated it", "hover cat", "Oh Hai I upgraded your RAM," "WANT", "DO NOT WANT!," "Fail",<ref>[http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/the_web/article3304328.ece Microtrends: Failure - Times Online<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> "NOM NOM NOM", "Halp!", and "Proceed."   References to walruses (LOLRUSes) and buckets (bukkits) are occasionally made.

[[Image:Yet another lolcat.jpg|thumb|200px|A feline in an [[iMac]]]]
Many of the first lolcats are believed to have originated from the [[Anonymous (group)|anonymous]] imageboard [[4chan]] sometime around [[2005]]<ref>[http://www.thestar.com/living/article/257955 TheStar.com | living | Funny how `stupid' site is addictive<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite web

More recently, the syntax of lolcat captions was used as the basis for [[LOLCODE]], an [[esoteric programming language]] with interpreters and compilers available in [[.NET framework]], [[perl]], etc.<ref name="Silverman"/> There is also an effort underway to translate the [[Christian Bible]] into the language of the lolcats, called the [[LOLCat Bible Translation Project]].<ref>http://www.latimes.com/technology/la-ca-lolcat16dec16,1,6069575.story</ref><ref>[http://www.modbee.com/2219/story/169247.html The Modesto Bee | The Gospel according to kitty<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
