'''Pan''' ({{pronEng|ˈpæn}} {{respell|{{sm|pan}}}}, or as in Greek ''Πάν'') is the innermost moon of [[Saturn]]. It is a [[walnut]]-shaped small moon about 35 kilometres across and 23&nbsp;km high that orbits within the [[Encke Gap]] in Saturn's [[A Ring]]. It acts as a [[shepherd satellite|ring shepherd]] and is responsible for keeping the Encke Gap free of ring particles.

==Prediction==
[[Image:Pans highway 3-05-07.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The image shows Pan orbiting in the Encke Gap.]]

The existence of a moon in the Encke Gap was first predicted by Jeffrey N. Cuzzi and Jeffrey D. Scargle in 1985, based on wavy edges of the gap which indicated a gravitational disturbance.<ref>Cuzzi, J. N.; and Scargle, J. D.; [http://adsabs.harvard.edu//full/seri/ApJ../0292//0000276.000.html ''Wavy Edges Suggest Moonlet in Encke's Gap''], Astrophysical Journal, Vol. 292 (May 1, 1985), pp. 276–290</ref> In 1986 Showalter ''et al.'' inferred its orbit and mass by modeling its gravitational wake. They arrived at a very precise prediction of 133,603 ± 10&nbsp;km for the semi-major axis and a mass of 5&ndash;10{{e|&minus;12}}Saturn masses, and inferred that there was only a single moon within the Encke gap.<ref name="Showalter1986">{{cite journal | author= Showalter, M. R.; ''et al.''| title= ''Satellite "wakes" and the orbit of the Encke Gap moonlet''| journal= Icarus| year= 1986| volume= 66| pages= 297| url= http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1986Icar...66..297S&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=444b66a47d24282 | doi = 10.1016/0019-1035(86)90160-0}}</ref> The actual semi-major axis differs by 19&nbsp;km and the actual mass is 8.6{{e|&minus;12}} of Saturn's.

The moon was later found within 1° of the predicted position. The search was undertaken by considering all ''[[Voyager 2]]'' images and using a computer calculation to predict whether the moon would be visible under sufficiently favorable conditions in each one. Every qualifying Voyager 2 image with resolution better than ~50&nbsp;km/pixel shows Pan clearly. In all, it appears in eleven ''Voyager 2'' images.<ref name="Showalter1990">{{cite journal | author=Showalter, M.

==Orbit==
The [[eccentricity (orbit)|eccentricity]] of Pan's orbit causes its distance from Saturn to vary by ~4&nbsp;km.  Its [[inclination]], which would cause it to move up and down, is not distinguishable from zero with present data.  The [[Encke Gap]], within which Pan orbits, is about 325&nbsp;km wide.

==Geography==
[[Image:Pan Rev09.2x.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Pan in the center of the image, occupying the Encke Division in Saturn's rings. Its walnut-like shape is clearly visible]]
''[[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]]'' scientists have described Pan as "[[walnut]]-shaped"<ref>[http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08320 "PIA08320: Cruising with Pan"], ''[[Planetary Photojournal]]''.</ref> owing to the [[equatorial ridge]], similar to that on [[Atlas (moon)|Atlas]], that is visible in images. The ridge is due to ring material that Pan has swept up from the Encke gap.

==Pan ringlet==
[[Image:PIA06534 Encke Division.jpg|thumb|240px|Closeup of the Encke Division. The central ringlet is coincident with Pan's orbit.]]
The Encke Division contains a ringlet that is coincident with Pan's orbit, indicating that Pan maintains the particles in [[horseshoe orbit]]s.

==Name==
The moon was named on 16 September 1991,<ref>[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/05300/05347.html IAUC 5347: ''Satellites of Saturn and Neptune''] 1991 September 16 (naming the moon)</ref> after the mythological [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], who was (among other things) the god of shepherds.  This is a reference to Pan's role as a [[shepherd moon]].  It is also designated '''{{nowrap|Saturn XVIII}}'''.<ref name="Gazetteer">{{cite web

It was discovered by Mark R. Showalter in 1990 from analysis of old ''Voyager 2'' probe photos and received the provisional designation '''{{nowrap|S/1981 S 13}}''' because the discovery images dated back to 1981.<ref name="iauc5052">[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iauc/05000/05052.html IAUC 5052: ''Saturn''] July 16, 1990 (discovery)</ref>

There is also an [[asteroid]] called [[4450 Pan]].
