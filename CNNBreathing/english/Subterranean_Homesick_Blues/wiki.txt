"'''Subterranean Homesick Blues'''" is a song written by [[Bob Dylan]], originally released on the album ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'' in March 1965. The following month it was issued as a single, becoming his first Top 40 [[Billboard Hot 100]] hit and going Top 10 in the UK. It was subsequently re-released on numerous compilations such as ''[[Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits]]'' (1967). One of Dylan's first 'electric' pieces, "Subterranean Homesick Blues" was also notable for its innovative [[music video|film clip]], which first appeared in [[D. A. Pennebaker]]'s documentary, ''[[Dont Look Back]]''.

==References and allusions==
:''"Subterranean Homesick Blues" was, in fact, an extraordinary three-way amalgam of [[Jack Kerouac]], the [[Arlo Guthrie|Guthrie]]/[[Pete Seeger]] song "Taking It Easy" ('mom was in the kitchen preparing to eat/sis was in the pantry looking for some yeast') and the riffed-up rock'n'roll poetry of [[Chuck Berry|Berry]]'s "Too Much Monkey Business".''<ref>
[http://www.uncut.co.uk/music/bob_dylan/special_features/27 uncut.co.uk]</ref>

While Dylan was not a member of the original [[beat generation|Beat]] circles of the 1950s, Kerouac's ''[[The Subterraneans]]'', a novel published in 1958 about the Beats, has been cited as a possible inspiration for the song's title.<ref>[http://www.city-journal.org/printable.php?id=1834 city-journal.org]</ref>  Stretching further back, the title alludes to ''[[Notes from Underground]]'', a novel by [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]], whose works were popular with Beat writers such as Kerouac and [[Allen Ginsberg]].{{Fact|date=April 2007}}

The song's first line is a reference to the production of [[LSD]] and the politics of the era: "Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine / I'm on the pavement thinkin' about the Government".<ref name="My Back Pages">Andy Gill (1998). ''Classic Bob Dylan 1962-69: My Back Pages'': pp.68-69,96</ref> The song also depicts some of the growing conflicts between "straight" or "square" (40-hour workers) and the emerging 1960s [[counterculture]]. The widespread use of [[recreational drugs]], and turmoil surrounding the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]] were both starting to take hold of the nation, and Dylan's hyperkinetic lyrics were dense with up-to-the-minute allusions to important emerging elements in the 1960s [[youth culture]].  According to rock journalist Andy Gill, "an entire generation recognized the zeitgeist in the verbal whirlwind of 'Subterranean Homesick Blues'."<ref name="My Back Pages"/> 

The song also throws up a number of references to the struggles surrounding the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American civil rights movement]] ("Better stay away from those / That carry around a [[firehose]]"). In spite of the political nature of the lyrics, the song went on to become the first [[Top 40]] hit for Dylan in the [[United States]].<ref>[http://www.sundazed.com/Merchant2/merchant.mv?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=S&Product_Code=LP+5070 sundazed.com]</ref>

In addition to the song's influence on music, the song was used in what became one of the first "modern" promotional film clips - the forerunner of what later  became known as the [[music video]].  Although ''Rolling Stone'' lists it as the 7th on its list of "100 Top Music Videos",<ref>[http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1993/rsvideo.htm rockonthenet.com]</ref> the original clip was actually the opening segment of [[D. A. Pennebaker]]'s film, ''[[Dont Look Back]]'', a documentary on Bob Dylan's first tour of [[England]] in 1965.  In the film, Dylan, who came up with the idea, holds up cue cards for the audience, with selected words and phrases from the lyrics. The cue cards were written by Dylan himself, [[Donovan]], [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Neuwirth]].<ref name="My Back Pages"/> While staring at the camera, he flips the cards as the song plays.  There are intentional misspellings and puns throughout the clip, for instance when the song's lyrics say "eleven dollar bills" the poster says "20 dollars".  The clip was shot in in an alley behind the [[Savoy Hotel]] in [[London]] where poet Ginsberg and Neuwirth make a [[cameo role|cameo]] in the background. For use as a [[Trailer (film)|trailer]], the following text was superimposed at the end of the clip while Dylan and Ginsberg are exiting the frame: "Surfacing Here Soon | Bob Dylan in | Dont Look Now by D. A. Pennebaker".

In addition to the Savoy Hotel clip, two alternate promotional films were shot: one in a park where Dylan, Neuwirth and Ginsberg are joined by a fourth man, and another shot on the roof of an unknown building (possibly the Savoy Hotel). A montage of the clips can be seen in the documentary ''[[No Direction Home]]''.

He also filmed a video for the former, with Ski dressed as Dylan and dropping cue cards as in the "Subterranean" clip.
