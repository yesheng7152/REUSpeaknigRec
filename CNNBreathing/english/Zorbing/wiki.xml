'''Zorbing''' ('''globe-riding''', '''sphereing''', '''orbing''') is the recreation or sport of rolling downhill inside an orb, generally made of transparent plastic.  Zorbing is generally performed on a gentle slope, but can also be done on a level surface, permitting more rider control.  In the absence of hills some operators have constructed inflatable, wooden or metal ramps. There are two types of orbs, harnessed and non-harnessed. Non-harness orbs carry up to three riders, while the harness orbs are constructed for one to two riders. Double-harness spheres have different slope requirements, and must only be operated in specific locations.  The longer runs are approximately half a mile. The first zorbing site was established in [[Rotorua]], New Zealand, by David and Andrew Akers.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | url=http://www.theogo.com/About_History.html | title=History of Zorbing | publisher=Outdoor Gravity NZ Ltd | accessdate =March 1, 2010}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

In 1994, Dwane van der Sluis and Andrew Akers conceived the idea for a type of sphere in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], calling their invention the &quot;Zorb&quot;.  With two other investors they created the firm ''ZORB Limited'', and set to work commercializing sphereing.  Their business model was to develop the activity world-wide via a [[franchising|franchise]] system.  In 2000, van der Sluis exited from the company to return to his career as a software engineer; Akers continued to run the company as CEO until April 2006, when he resigned.  Around this time, ZORB's European master franchise operator, Michael Stemp, and Hungarian master franchise operator, Attila Csató, ended their affiliation with ''ZORB'' and started a manufacturing and sphereing consultancy firm, ''Downhill Revolution''<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web

Andrew Akers and his brother David Akers have since teamed up with Chris Roberts to create the OGO (Outdoor Gravity Orb) and The Fishpipe.

Sphereing is also referred to as Orbing or Zorbing, and Zorbing entered the Concise [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 2001 where it was defined as: &quot;a sport in which a participant is secured inside an inner capsule in a large, transparent ball which is then rolled along the ground or down hills&quot;.

<h level="2" i="2">==Construction==</h>
The zorb is double-sectioned, with one ball inside the other with an air layer between.<template><title>fact</title><part><name>date</name><equals>=</equals><value>January 2013</value></part></template> This acts as a [[shock absorber]] for the rider, damping bumps while traveling. Orbs are lightweight and made of flexible plastic, as opposed to the rigid plastic, for example, of a [[hamster ball]]. Many orbs have straps to hold the rider in place, while others leave the rider free to walk the orb around or be tossed about freely by the rolling motion. A typical orb is about <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>3</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>m</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>0</value></part></template> in diameter, with an inner orb size of about <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>2</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>m</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>0</value></part></template>, leaving a 50–60&amp;nbsp;centimetre (20–24&amp;nbsp;in) air cushion around the riders.  The plastic is approximately <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>0.8</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>mm</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>2</value></part></template> thick.<template><title>fact</title><part><name>date</name><equals>=</equals><value>January 2013</value></part></template> The inner and outer orb are connected by numerous (often hundreds of) small nylon strings. Orbs have one or two tunnel-like entrances.

<h level="2" i="3">==Facilities==</h>
Zorbing is performed at commercial locations, where prospective riders pay a fee for each ride or for a whole day's activity.  'Hill-Rolling' (the generic name for this activity) is practiced in [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], the middle of [[Sweden]], [[Estonia]], the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Australia]], [[North Pole]],
[[Canada]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], the [[Slovak Republic]], [[Switzerland]], [[Japan]], [[Kochi]] in [[India]], Phuket in  [[Thailand]] and [[Slovenia]].<template><title>Citation needed</title><part><name>date</name><equals>=</equals><value>March 2008</value></part></template>  In the [[United States]], there are facilities in [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]], [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee]] (near [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]), [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]], and Ski Roundtop, Pennsylvania.  Several franchise-based companies (''SphereMania'', ''Orb 360'') as well as ''OGO Inc'', ''Downhill Revolution'' which do not sell franchises but do offer consultancy services and products to suitable operators) have entered the market.

<h level="2" i="4">==Records==</h>
