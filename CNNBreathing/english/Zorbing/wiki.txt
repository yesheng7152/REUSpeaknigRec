'''Zorbing''' ('''globe-riding''', '''sphereing''', '''orbing''') is the recreation or sport of rolling downhill inside an orb, generally made of transparent plastic.  Zorbing is generally performed on a gentle slope, but can also be done on a level surface, permitting more rider control.  In the absence of hills some operators have constructed inflatable, wooden or metal ramps. There are two types of orbs, harnessed and non-harnessed. Non-harness orbs carry up to three riders, while the harness orbs are constructed for one to two riders. Double-harness spheres have different slope requirements, and must only be operated in specific locations.  The longer runs are approximately half a mile. The first zorbing site was established in [[Rotorua]], New Zealand, by David and Andrew Akers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theogo.com/About_History.html | title=History of Zorbing | publisher=Outdoor Gravity NZ Ltd | accessdate =March 1, 2010}}</ref>

==History==

Hamster balls, hard plastic single layer spheres made for small rodent pets, have been manufactured and sold since at least the 1970s.<ref>{{cite web

This device was eventually cut up for scrap, with some of the plastic remnants used to cover a compost heap.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>  Human spheres have been depicted in mass media since 1990 when the [[gladiators (television franchise)|Gladiators]] event [[Atlaspheres]] first aired, albeit with steel balls.

In 1994, Dwane van der Sluis and Andrew Akers conceived the idea for a type of sphere in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]], calling their invention the "Zorb".  With two other investors they created the firm ''ZORB Limited'', and set to work commercializing sphereing.  Their business model was to develop the activity world-wide via a [[franchising|franchise]] system.  In 2000, van der Sluis exited from the company to return to his career as a software engineer; Akers continued to run the company as CEO until April 2006, when he resigned.  Around this time, ZORB's European master franchise operator, Michael Stemp, and Hungarian master franchise operator, Attila Csató, ended their affiliation with ''ZORB'' and started a manufacturing and sphereing consultancy firm, ''Downhill Revolution''<ref>{{cite web

Andrew Akers and his brother David Akers have since teamed up with Chris Roberts to create the OGO (Outdoor Gravity Orb) and The Fishpipe.

Sphereing is also referred to as Orbing or Zorbing, and Zorbing entered the Concise [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 2001 where it was defined as: "a sport in which a participant is secured inside an inner capsule in a large, transparent ball which is then rolled along the ground or down hills".

==Construction==
The zorb is double-sectioned, with one ball inside the other with an air layer between.{{fact|date=January 2013}} This acts as a [[shock absorber]] for the rider, damping bumps while traveling. Orbs are lightweight and made of flexible plastic, as opposed to the rigid plastic, for example, of a [[hamster ball]]. Many orbs have straps to hold the rider in place, while others leave the rider free to walk the orb around or be tossed about freely by the rolling motion. A typical orb is about {{convert|3|m|0}} in diameter, with an inner orb size of about {{convert|2|m|0}}, leaving a 50–60&nbsp;centimetre (20–24&nbsp;in) air cushion around the riders.  The plastic is approximately {{convert|0.8|mm|2}} thick.{{fact|date=January 2013}} The inner and outer orb are connected by numerous (often hundreds of) small nylon strings. Orbs have one or two tunnel-like entrances.

==Facilities==
Zorbing is performed at commercial locations, where prospective riders pay a fee for each ride or for a whole day's activity.  'Hill-Rolling' (the generic name for this activity) is practiced in [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[New Zealand]], the middle of [[Sweden]], [[Estonia]], the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] in [[Australia]], [[North Pole]],
[[Canada]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Poland]], the [[Slovak Republic]], [[Switzerland]], [[Japan]], [[Kochi]] in [[India]], Phuket in  [[Thailand]] and [[Slovenia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  In the [[United States]], there are facilities in [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]], [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee]] (near [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]]), [[Amesbury, Massachusetts]], and Ski Roundtop, Pennsylvania.  Several franchise-based companies (''SphereMania'', ''Orb 360'') as well as ''OGO Inc'', ''Downhill Revolution'' which do not sell franchises but do offer consultancy services and products to suitable operators) have entered the market.

==Records==
The [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]] recognises two sphereing records, set over two consecutive days in 2006:
*Longest sphereing ride held by Steve Camp who travelled {{convert|570|m|0}}.{{fact|date=January 2013}}
*Fastest sphereing ride held by Keith Kolver who reached a speed of {{convert|52|km/h|0}}.{{fact|date=January 2013}}
*Fastest 100m in a Zorb – 26.59 seconds. Held by [[Andrew Flintoff]] who broke the record as part of his attempt to break 12 world records in 12 hours for [[BBC]] [[Sport Relief]].{{fact|date=January 2013}}

==Deaths==
In June 2009 a teacher died and a pupil was seriously injured in the Czech Republic while trying zorbing.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.news.com.au/top-stories/teacher-killed-in-zorbing-accident/story-e6frfkp9-1225722279320 | work= News.com.au | title= Teacher killed in zorbing accident | date=June 5, 2009}}</ref>

In January 2013, a man died from a broken neck and another was seriously injured when a Zorb rolled out of control down a mountain, hitting rocks and eventually coming to a stop a kilometre away on a frozen lake in [[Dombay, Karachay-Cherkess Republic]].<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/01/09/168943032/zorbing-death-brings-call-for-safety-rules-fatal-ride-captured-on-video|work=[[NPR]] | title= 'Zorbing' Death Brings Call For Safety Rules; Fatal Ride Captured On Video| date=January 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/VIDEO-Zorb-death-at-Russian-ski-resort/tabid/313/articleID/282433/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ | title= Fatal Zorb accident at ski resort| date=January 9, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/world/europe/zorbing-accident-kills-1-man-and-injures-another-in-russia.html |work=[[New York Times]] | title= Man in Plastic Ball Dies on Russian Ski Slope| date=January 11, 2013}}</ref>  The incident was caught on camera and uploaded to the Internet.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/VIDEO-Zorb-death-at-Russian-ski-resort/tabid/313/articleID/282433/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ | title= VIDEO: Zorb death at Russian ski resort| date=January 9, 2013}}</ref> After the incident made international headlines, Russian authorities called for tougher safety laws. <ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Russia-probes-Zorb-death/tabid/417/articleID/282548/Default.aspx |work=3 News NZ | title= Russia probes Zorb death| date=January 10, 2012}}</ref>

==''Late Show with David Letterman''==
The OGO (a new zorb ball brand developed by the inventors of the original zorb)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theogo.com/About_index.html|title=About OGO – by the inventors of zorbing}}</ref> appeared on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on Wednesday 14 July 2010. [[David Letterman]] tried out the OGO in the studio before his guest [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]] rode inside the OGO on 53rd Street outside the [[CBS]] studios in New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theogo.com/OGO_Images_Videos.html|title=video of David Letterman and Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing with the OGO}}</ref>

==Zorbing in popular culture==
In his 1930 novel the Russian science fiction writer [[Alexander Belyayev]] described a transparent ball encasing the scientist who was thus able to walk in the jungle protected.{{fact|date=January 2013}} In the novel the ball was made of [[caoutchouc]].

A sphere can be seen in Regis Rollands 1986 film Apocalypse Snow. 

Jackie Chan is seen zorbing down a cliff in the opening scenes of [[Armour_of_God_II:_Operation_Condor|Armour of God II]]

Zorbing was shown as part of a Roadblock on Season Five of the American television show The Amazing Race.{{fact|date=January 2013}}

In the second series of Fresh Meat Josie planned to go Zorbing.{{fact|date=January 2013}}
