'''OpenBSD''' is a [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]] descended from [[Berkeley Software Distribution]] (BSD), a [[Unix]] derivative developed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. It was [[fork (software development)|forked]] from [[NetBSD]] by project leader [[Theo de Raadt]] in late 1995. The project is widely known for the developers' insistence on [[open-source]] code and quality documentation, uncompromising position on [[software licensing]], and focus on [[computer insecurity|security]] and code correctness. The project is coordinated from de Raadt's home in [[Calgary]], Alberta, Canada. Its logo and mascot is a [[pufferfish]] named Puffy.

OpenBSD includes a number of security features absent or optional in other operating systems, and has a tradition in which developers [[code audit|audit]] the source code for [[software bug]]s and security problems. The project maintains strict policies on licensing and prefers the [[open-source]] [[BSD licence]] and its variants—in the past this has led to a comprehensive licence audit and moves to remove or replace code under licences found less acceptable.

As with most other BSD-based operating systems, the OpenBSD [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] and [[Userland (computing)|userland]] programs, such as the [[Unix shell|shell]] and common tools like [[cat (Unix)|cat]] and [[ps (Unix)|ps]], are developed together in one source code repository. Third-party software is available as binary packages or may be built from source using the [[ports collection|ports tree]].

The OpenBSD project maintains ports for 17 different [[computer hardware|hardware]] [[platform (computing)|platforms]], including the [[DEC Alpha]], [[Intel]] [[Intel 80386|i386]], [[Hewlett-Packard]] [[PA-RISC]], [[AMD]] [[AMD64]] and [[Motorola 68000]] processors, [[Apple Computer|Apple]]'s [[PowerPC]] machines, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[SPARC]] and [[SPARC64]]-based computers, the [[VAX]] and the [[Sharp Zaurus]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;plat&quot;</attr></ext>

In October 1995, de Raadt founded OpenBSD, a new project forked from NetBSD 1.0. The initial release, OpenBSD 1.2, was made in July 1996, followed in October of the same year by OpenBSD 2.0.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>de Raadt, Theo.

The latest release, OpenBSD 4.9, appeared on May 1, 2011.

On 25 July 2007, OpenBSD developer Bob Beck announced the formation of the [[OpenBSD Foundation]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.openbsdfoundation.org |title=Official OpenBSD Foundation site |publisher=Openbsdfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-09}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> a Canadian [[not-for-profit corporation]] formed to &quot;act as a single point of contact for persons and organizations requiring a legal entity to deal with when they wish to support OpenBSD.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Beck, Bob.

Just how widely OpenBSD is used is hard to ascertain: its developers neither publish nor collect usage statistics, and there are few other sources of information. In September 2005, the nascent BSD Certification Group performed a usage survey which revealed that 32.8% of BSD users (1420 of 4330 respondents) were using OpenBSD,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=survey</attr><inner>[http://www.bsdcertification.org/ The BSD Certification Group.]; [[PDF]] of [http://www.bsdcertification.org/downloads/pr_20051031_usage_survey_en_en.pdf usage survey results].</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> placing it second of the four major BSD variants, behind [[FreeBSD]] with 77% and ahead of NetBSD with 16.3%.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Multiple selections were permitted as a user may use multiple BSD variants side by side.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The [[DistroWatch]] [[website]], well-known in the [[Linux]] community and often used as a reference for popularity, publishes [[Hit (internet)|page hits]] for each of the [[Linux distribution]]s and other operating systems it covers.

<h level="2" i="2">== Open source and open documentation ==</h>

When OpenBSD was created, Theo de Raadt decided that the source should be easily available for anyone to read at any time, so, with the assistance of Chuck Cranor,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://chuck.cranor.org/ Chuck Cranor's site].</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> he set up a public, anonymous [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] server. This was the first of its kind in the software development world: at the time, the tradition was for only a small team of developers to have access to a project's source repository.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;cvs&quot;</attr><inner>Cranor, Chuck D, de Raadt, Theo. ''[http://www.usenix.org/event/usenix99/full_papers/cranor_f/cranor_f.pdf Opening The Source Repository With Anonymous CVS],'' USENIX June 6–11, 1999. Visited April 07, 2010.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Craner and de Raadt concluded that this practice &quot;runs counter to the open source philosophy&quot; and is inconvenient to contributors. de Raadt's decision allowed &quot;users to take a more active role&quot;, and signaled the project's belief in open and public access to source code.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;cvs&quot;</attr></ext>

A revealing incident regarding open documentation occurred in March 2005, when de Raadt posted a message<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>de Raadt, Theo. Mail to openbsd-misc: ''[http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=openbsd-misc&amp;m=111118558813932 Adaptec AAC raid support],'' March 18, 2005.

He announced that after four months of discussion, [[Adaptec]] had not disclosed the documentation required to improve the OpenBSD [[device driver|drivers]] for its AAC [[Disk array controller|RAID controllers]]. As in similar circumstances in the past, he encouraged the OpenBSD community to become involved and express their opinion to Adaptec. Shortly after this, FreeBSD [[committer]], former Adaptec employee and author of the FreeBSD AAC RAID support Scott Long,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://people.freebsd.org/~scottl/ Scott Long's site].</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> castigated de Raadt<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Long, Scott.

However, the FreeBSD project has a different policy and much of the Adaptec RAID management code Scott Long proposed as assistance for OpenBSD was closed source or written under an NDA. As no documentation was forthcoming before the deadline for the release of OpenBSD 3.7, support for Adaptec AAC RAID controllers was removed from the standard OpenBSD kernel.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/sys/arch/i386/conf/GENERIC?rev=1.406 OpenBSD CVS repository, commit by Theo de Raadt].

The OpenBSD policy on openness extends to hardware documentation: in the slides for a December 2006 presentation, de Raadt explained that without it &quot;developers often make mistakes writing drivers&quot;, and pointed out that &quot;the [oh my god, I got it to work] rush is harder to achieve, and some developers just give up&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;deraadtopencon06&quot;</attr><inner>de Raadt, Theo.

<h level="2" i="3">== Licensing ==</h>

A goal of the OpenBSD project is to &quot;maintain the spirit of the original Berkeley Unix [[copyright]]s&quot;, which permitted a &quot;relatively un-encumbered Unix source distribution&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>OpenBSD.org. ''[http://www.openbsd.org/policy.html Copyright Policy].'' Visited January 7, 2006.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> To this end, the [[ISC license|Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) licence]], a simplified version of the BSD licence with wording removed that is unnecessary under the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne convention]], is preferred for new code, but the [[MIT License|MIT]] or BSD licences are accepted. The widely used [[GNU General Public License]] is considered overly restrictive in comparison with these.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>NewsForge.

In June 2001, triggered by concerns over Darren Reed's modification of IPFilter's licence wording, a systematic licence audit of the OpenBSD ports and source trees was undertaken.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Linux.com.

To ensure that all licences were properly adhered to, an attempt was made to contact all the relevant copyright holders: some pieces of code were removed, many were replaced, and others, including the [[multicast]] [[routing]] tools, mrinfo and map-mbone,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Man pages: [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=mrinfo mrinfo] and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=map-mbone map-mbone].</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> which were licensed by [[Xerox]] for research only, were relicensed so that OpenBSD could continue to use them; also removed during this audit was all software produced by [[Daniel J.

To reduce the risk of a vulnerability or misconfiguration allowing [[privilege escalation]], some programs have been written or adapted to make use of [[privilege separation]], [[privilege revocation]] and [[chroot]]ing. Privilege separation is a technique, pioneered on OpenBSD and inspired by the [[principle of least privilege]], where a program is split into two or more parts, one of which performs privileged operations and the other—almost always the bulk of the code—runs without privilege.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[[Niels Provos]]. [http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/ssh/privsep.html Privilege Separated OpenSSH]. Visited January 30, 2006.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Privilege revocation is similar and involves a program performing any necessary operations with the privileges it starts with then dropping them. Chrooting involves restricting an application to one section of the [[file system]], prohibiting it from accessing areas that contain private or system files. Developers have applied these features to OpenBSD versions of common applications, including [[tcpdump]] and the [[Apache (webserver)|Apache]] [[web server]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>OpenBSD CVS logs showing addition of privilege separation to [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/usr.sbin/tcpdump/privsep.c tcpdump] and [http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=httpd httpd] man page describing the chroot mechanism.

The project has a policy of continually auditing code for problems, work that developer Marc Espie has described as &quot;never finished ... more a question of process than of a specific bug being hunted&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>O'Reilly Network.

[[Linux kernel]] creator [[Linus Torvalds]] has expressed the view that development efforts should be focused on fixing general problems rather than targeting security issues, as non-security bugs are more numerous (&quot;all the boring normal bugs are _way_ more important, just because there's a lot more of them&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Torvalds, Linus.
