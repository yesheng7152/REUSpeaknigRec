<h level="3" i="2">=== Early Years ===</h>

Samuel A. Scribner, son of Alexander St. James Scribner and Cynthia Cheseboro Scribner, was born August 18, 1859 near [[Brookville, Pennsylvania|Brookville]], [[Pennsylvania]], county seat of [[Jefferson County, Pennsylvania|Jefferson County]]. Serving as a tuba player in the village band, Scribner spent his whole life in show business.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Obituary, New York Times, July 9, 1941</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  In the summer of 1879 he joined a small circus called, rather grandly, Rogers and Campbell United Aggregation and Grabd Equestriculum Hippo Comique.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>The Bronxville Journal; Bronxville NY Historical Conservancy, Vol. two, 2002</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  For nearly twenty years he worked his way up the ranks of various circuses, traveling by mule train six days a week, six months a year.  By 1892, he partnered with Neil Smith to operate Scribner &amp; Smiths All New Enormous Combined Shows.  During the winter months, he acted in and produced [[melodramas]] in various theater companies in the United States and Canada.  In the late 1890s, he sold his circus to [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus|Barnum &amp; Bailey]] and switched to burlesque.

In 1902, Scribner and his partner, John Herbert Mack, formed the Columbia Amusement Company, also known as the &quot;Columbia Wheel&quot; or &quot;Eastern Wheel.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>''The Oxford Companion to American Theatre'', 3rd edn. (2004) G. Bordman, T.S. Hischak eds., Oxford University Press</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> With a season running from Fall to Spring, Columbia would present forty or more separate shows in forty different theaters.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Obituary, New York Herald Tribune, July 11, 1941</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  Each week each show would travel from one theater to the next, rotating around the American Northeast and Midwest like forty spokes on a great wheel. 

On January 3, 1910, the company opened its flagship theater in [[Times Square]], at the north-east corner of Seventh Avenue and 47th Street.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>http://cinematreasures.org/theater/501/</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  In its time, Columbia Amusement ruled American burlesque, and Scribner, its imperious operator, was determined to make burlesque both clean and profitable.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>The American Burlesque Show, Irving Zeidman, 1967</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>
In 1913 the Eastern wheel and the rival Western wheel were consolidated into the Columbia Amusement Company, headed by Scribner and [[Isidore Herk]]. 
The combined operation put on fairly clean shows, as had the Eastern Wheel.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book|page=249 |last=Allen|first=Robert Clyde|title=Horrible Prettiness: Burlesque and American Culture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4IoXcZyKKJoC&amp;pg=PA249|accessdate=2014-05-14 |year=1991|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-4316-1}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

One of Scribner's early hires at Columbia was [[Will Rogers]].  In 1904, Rogers was working the roof of [[Willie Hammerstein]]'s theater in New York.  Shribner hired him away, raising his salary from $150 to $250 per week.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>WILL rogers on Sam Scribner, Un-named New York newspaper article, 1925</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  On January 3, 1925, in anticipation of the Fifteenth Anniversary Gala of the Columbia Theater in New York, Rogers sent a telegram stating &quot;I WILL BE THERE WEDNESDAY NIGHT FOR YOU TO DO AN ACT ANNOUNCE THE ACTS TAKE TICKETS OR SWEEP OUT FOR YOU I SAID FOR YOU SAM SCRIBNER&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>J.
