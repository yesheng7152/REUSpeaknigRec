'''New York State Route&nbsp;174''' (also known as '''NY&nbsp;174''') is a [[state highway]] in the county of [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga]], located in [[Central New York]], United States. The highway is {{convert|16.70|mi|km}} long and passes through mostly rural regions. Route&nbsp;174 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 41|NY&nbsp;41]] in [[Borodino, New York|Borodino]], a hamlet of [[Spafford, New York|Spafford]]. It heads northward for most of its length, except for short distances in the villages of [[Marcellus (village), New York|Marcellus]] and [[Camillus (village), New York|Camillus]]. The route ends at a junction with [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] west of Camillus, at the west end of the Route&nbsp;5 Camillus bypass. Route&nbsp;174 is located along a large [[Geologic map|mapped]] [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] [[bedrock]] [[Geological unit|unit]], known as the [[Marcellus Formation]]. The formation is named for an [[outcrop]] found near the town of [[Marcellus (town), New York|Marcellus, New York]], during a [[geological survey]] in 1839.

The road was first laid out in the early 19th century following the path of [[Nine Mile Creek]], which connected several early settlements in Central New York. The northern half of the route, between the villages of Marcellus and Camillus, was later improved as a [[plank road]] in 1855 by a private corporation that collected tolls from travelers on the road. The state took over the maintenance of the road by the beginning of the 20th century. The former plank road and an extension south to [[Otisco Lake]] and southwest to [[Skaneateles Lake]] was first designated as Route&nbsp;174 in the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 state highway renumbering]]. Since then, several minor realignments have been made in the areas of the villages of Marcellus and Camillus to accommodate newly built bypasses.

Route&nbsp;174 begins its {{convert|16|mi|km|sp=us|adj=on}} route through Onondaga County at an intersection with [[New York State Route 41|NY&nbsp;41]] in the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]] of [[Borodino, New York|Borodino]], on the shores of [[Skaneateles Lake]].<ref name="google1">{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&rlz=1T4ADBF_enUS232US232&q=from:+Rose+Hill+Rd/RT-174+%4042.858837,+-76.337914+to:+RT-174+%4042.930502,+-76.335425&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wl |title=overview map of NY 174 from Borodino to Marcellus |accessdate=December 7, 2007}}</ref> The road heads north, passing to the east of Hardscrabble Point, to an intersection with Elbert Road (County Route&nbsp;131) where it turns east. The highway then heads eastward for about a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) to a turn along the shore of [[Otisco Lake]]. It follows the shoreline of the lake northward into the town of [[Marcellus (town), New York|Marcellus]], soon entering the hamlet of [[Marietta, New York|Marietta]]. North of Marietta, the lake narrows into the [[Nine Mile Creek]], which parallels Route&nbsp;174 for the rest of the highway's length.<ref name="google1"/>

Within the town of Marcellus, Route&nbsp;174 intersects and becomes concurrent with [[U.S. Route 20 in New York|U.S. Route&nbsp;20]] for about {{convert|0.3|mi|km}} until Sevier Road.<ref name="google2">{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&rlz=1T4ADBF_enUS232US232&q=from:+RT-174+%4042.930502,+-76.335425+to:+RT-174/W+Seneca+Turnpike+%4042.982708,+-76.334229&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wl |title=overview map of NY 174 in Marcellus |accessdate=December 7, 2007}}</ref> Route&nbsp;174 continues north along Sevier Road, still paralleling the creek, towards the village of [[Marcellus (village), New York|Marcellus]]. South of the village line, [[New York State Route 175|NY&nbsp;175]] joins Route&nbsp;174 and the two routes are concurrent for about 2&nbsp;miles (3&nbsp;km). The two roads go around the southeast border of the village, passing by the county park, then split in different directions just east of the village. Route&nbsp;175 turns to the east while Route&nbsp;174 turns to the west along the West Seneca Turnpike, entering the village of Marcellus.<ref name="google2"/>

Route&nbsp;174 passes through the village center then turns north along North Street and heads out of the village,<ref name="google3">{{google maps |url=http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&rlz=1T4ADBF_enUS232US232&q=from:+RT-174/W+Seneca+Turnpike+%4042.982708,+-76.334229+to:+RT-174+W+%4043.034623,+-76.321409&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wl |title=overview map of NY 174 from Marcellus to NY 5 |accessdate=December 7, 2007}}</ref> turning northward through the hamlet of [[Marcellus Falls, New York|Marcellus Falls]]. After Marcellus, the land around the route becomes more developed with residential areas becoming more common. About {{convert|0.3|mi|km|adj=on}} north of Marcellus, Route&nbsp;174 crosses Nine Mile Creek, and the bridge itself is designated as NY&nbsp;174X. This is an internal designation used by [[NYSDOT]] and is not signed as such.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nysdot.gov/main/bridgedata/repository/OnondagaBridgeData.pdf|title=Onondaga County Bridge Data|year=2008|accessdate=June 7, 2008|publisher=[[New York State Department of Transportation]]|format=PDF}}</ref>

The road continues north, still paralleling the Nine Mile Creek, into the town of [[Camillus (town), New York|Camillus]]. In Bennetts Corners, Route&nbsp;174 intersects with Forward Road (unsigned NY&nbsp;931F), a connector road to [[New York State Route 321|NY&nbsp;321]], then changes direction to head northeast. The road passes by Nose Hill before entering the village of [[Camillus (village), New York|Camillus]]. In the village center, Route&nbsp;174 makes a sharp turn to the west onto West Genesee Street, where it comes to an end just west of the village line at a junction with [[New York State Route 5|NY&nbsp;5]] (where its freeway begins) that includes a [[jughandle]], a slip road onto the freeway.<ref name="google3"/> NY&nbsp;174 is located along a geological feature known as a [[Geologic map|mapped]] [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] [[bedrock]] [[Geological unit|unit]], known as the [[Marcellus Formation]].<ref name=dispatch>{{cite news |url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/science/stories/2008/03/11/Sci_shale.ART_ART_03-11-08_B4_A99I7HO.html?print=yes |title=Low down, rich and stingy |first=Kevin |last=Mayhood |newspaper=[[The Columbus Dispatch]] |date=March 11, 2008 |accessdate=January 3, 2010}}</ref> The formation is named for an [[outcrop]] found near the town of [[Marcellus (town), New York|Marcellus, New York]], during a [[geological survey]] in 1839.<ref name=MGS1918>{{cite book | author = Clark, W.

Route&nbsp;174 has also had several minor realignments. After Route&nbsp;5 was realigned onto a new expressway from Camillus to Fairmount, Route&nbsp;174 was extended on its northern end to meet the west end of the bypass in Camillus. The new alignment makes a sharp hook west along the former Route&nbsp;5.<ref name="camillus"/><ref name="camillus quad"/> Route&nbsp;174 has also been relocated onto a southeastern bypass around the village of Marcellus that also carries Route&nbsp;175.
