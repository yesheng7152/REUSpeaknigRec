'''New York State Route&amp;nbsp;174''' (also known as '''NY&amp;nbsp;174''') is a [[state highway]] in the county of [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga]], located in [[Central New York]], United States. The highway is <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>16.70</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>mi</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>km</value></part></template> long and passes through mostly rural regions. Route&amp;nbsp;174 begins at an intersection with [[New York State Route 41|NY&amp;nbsp;41]] in [[Borodino, New York|Borodino]], a hamlet of [[Spafford, New York|Spafford]]. It heads northward for most of its length, except for short distances in the villages of [[Marcellus (village), New York|Marcellus]] and [[Camillus (village), New York|Camillus]]. The route ends at a junction with [[New York State Route 5|NY&amp;nbsp;5]] west of Camillus, at the west end of the Route&amp;nbsp;5 Camillus bypass. Route&amp;nbsp;174 is located along a large [[Geologic map|mapped]] [[Sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] [[bedrock]] [[Geological unit|unit]], known as the [[Marcellus Formation]]. The formation is named for an [[outcrop]] found near the town of [[Marcellus (town), New York|Marcellus, New York]], during a [[geological survey]] in 1839.

The road was first laid out in the early 19th century following the path of [[Nine Mile Creek]], which connected several early settlements in Central New York. The northern half of the route, between the villages of Marcellus and Camillus, was later improved as a [[plank road]] in 1855 by a private corporation that collected tolls from travelers on the road. The state took over the maintenance of the road by the beginning of the 20th century. The former plank road and an extension south to [[Otisco Lake]] and southwest to [[Skaneateles Lake]] was first designated as Route&amp;nbsp;174 in the [[1930 state highway renumbering (New York)|1930 state highway renumbering]]. Since then, several minor realignments have been made in the areas of the villages of Marcellus and Camillus to accommodate newly built bypasses.
