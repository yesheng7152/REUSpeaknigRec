'''George VI''' (Albert Frederick Arthur George; 14 December 1895 – 6 February 1952) was [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion]]s of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] from 11 December 1936 until his death. He was the last [[Emperor of India]] and the first [[Head of the Commonwealth]].

As the second son of [[George V|King George V]], he was not expected to inherit the throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, [[Edward VIII|Edward]]. He served in the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[World War I|First World War]], and after it took on the usual round of public engagements. He married [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1923 and they had two daughters, [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]].

George's elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII upon the death of their father in 1936. However, later that year Edward revealed his desire to marry the divorced American socialite [[Wallis Simpson]]. British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] advised Edward that for political and religious reasons he could not marry a divorced woman and remain king. [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|Edward abdicated]] in order to marry, and George ascended the throne as the third monarch of the [[House of Windsor]].

During George's reign the break-up of the [[British Empire]] and its transition into the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] accelerated. The parliament of the [[Irish Free State]] [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|removed]] direct mention of the monarch from [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|the country's constitution]] on the day of his accession. Within three years, the Empire and Commonwealth, except the Irish Free State, was at [[World War II|war]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. In the next two years, war with [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] followed. Though [[Allies of World War II|Britain and its allies]] were ultimately victorious, the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] rose as pre-eminent [[superpower|world powers]] and the British Empire declined. After the [[Indian Independence Act 1947|independence of India and Pakistan]] in 1947, George remained as king of both countries, but the title ''Emperor of India'' was abandoned in June 1948. Ireland [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|formally declared itself a republic]] and left the Commonwealth in 1949, and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year. George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by health problems in the later years of his reign. His elder daughter, Elizabeth, succeeded him.

George VI was born at [[York Cottage]], on the [[Sandringham House|Sandringham Estate]] in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Rhodes James, p. 90; Weir, p. 329</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> His father was Prince George, [[Duke of York]] (later [[George V|King George V]]), the second and eldest-surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]]). His mother was the Duchess of York (later [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]), the eldest child and only daughter of [[Francis, Duke of Teck|the Duke]] and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge|Duchess of Teck]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Weir, pp. 322–323, 329</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

His birthday (14 December 1895) was the anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert, the Prince Consort]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Judd, p. 3; Rhodes James, p. 90; Townsend, p. 15; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7–8</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been &quot;rather distressed&quot;. Two days later, he wrote again: &quot;I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name ''Albert'' to her&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Judd, pp. 4–5; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7–8</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: &quot;I am all impatience to see the ''new'' one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7–8</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Consequently, he was [[baptism|baptised]] &quot;Albert Frederick Arthur George&quot; at [[St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham|St. Mary Magdalene's Church]] near Sandringham three months later.<template><title>ref</title><part><name index="1"/><value>baptism</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>a</value></part></template> As a great-grandson of Queen Victoria, he was known formally as &quot;His Highness Prince Albert of York&quot; from birth.

Albert, as he was known, was fourth in line to the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and elder brother, [[Edward VIII|Edward]]. In 1898, Queen Victoria issued [[letters patent|Letters Patent]] that granted the children of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] ''[[Royal Highness]]'', and at the age of two, Albert became &quot;His Royal Highness Prince Albert of York&quot;.

He often suffered from ill health and was described as &quot;easily frightened and somewhat prone to tears&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 17–18</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> His parents were generally removed from their children's day-to-day upbringing, as was the norm in aristocratic families of that era. He had a [[stutter|stammer]] that lasted for many years, and was forced to write with his right hand although he was naturally [[Left-handedness|left-handed]]. He suffered from chronic stomach problems as well as [[genu valgum|knock knees]], for which he was forced to wear painful corrective splints.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;matthew&quot;</attr><inner>{{citation|first=H.

Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, and the Prince of Wales succeeded her as King Edward VII. Prince Albert moved up to third-in-line to the throne, after his father and elder brother.

<h level="2" i="2">==Military career and education==</h>
From 1909, Albert attended the [[Osborne House|Royal Naval College, Osborne]], as a naval [[cadet]]. In 1911, he came bottom of the class in the final examination, but despite this he progressed to the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Bradford, pp. 41–45; Judd, pp. 21–24; Rhodes James, p. 91</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> When Edward VII died in 1910, Albert's father became King George V.

In a time when royals were expected to marry fellow royals, it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife. In 1920, he met for the first time since childhood Lady [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], the youngest daughter of [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|the Earl]] and [[Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne]].

They were married on 26 April 1923 in [[Westminster Abbey]].

From December 1924 to April 1925, the Duke and Duchess toured [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]], and the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]], travelling via the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Aden]]. During the trip, they both went [[big game hunting]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Judd, pp. 89–93</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

The Duke and Duchess of York had two children: [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] (called &quot;Lilibet&quot; by the family), and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]].

King George V had severe reservations about Prince Edward, saying, &quot;I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Ziegler, p. 199</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> On 20 January 1936, George V died and Edward ascended the throne as Edward VIII. In the [[Vigil of the Princes]], Prince Albert and his three brothers took a shift standing guard over their father's body as it [[Lying in state|lay in state]], in a closed casket, in [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]].

As Edward was unmarried and had no children, Albert was the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne. Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward VIII [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] in order to marry his mistress, [[Wallis Simpson]], who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by British Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. Edward chose abdication in preference to abandoning his marriage plans. Thus Albert became king, a position he was reluctant to accept.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Judd, p. 140</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The day before the abdication, he went to London to see his mother, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].

On the day of the abdication, the [[Oireachtas]], the parliament of the [[Irish Free State]] [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|removed all direct mention of the monarch]] from the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|Irish constitution]]. The next day, it passed the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|External Relations Act]], which made provision for the monarch to act as the state's representative in foreign affairs. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Townsend, p. 93</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Courtier and journalist Dermot Morrah alleged that there was brief speculation as to the desirability of bypassing Albert (and his children) and his brother, [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], in favour of their younger brother [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]]. This seems to have been suggested on the grounds that Prince George was at that time the only brother with [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|a son]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Howarth, p. 63; Judd, p. 135</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Thus, at his Canadian residence, [[Rideau Hall]], George VI personally accepted and approved the [[Letter of Credence]] of the newly appointed U.S. Ambassador to Canada, [[Daniel Calhoun Roper]].

George VI's reign saw the acceleration of the dissolution of the [[British Empire]]. The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], had already acknowledged the evolution of the [[Dominion]]s into separate [[sovereignty|sovereign]] states. The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states, known as the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], gathered pace after the Second World War, especially during the ministry of [[Clement Attlee]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Townsend, p. 176</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> [[British India]] became the two independent dominions of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] in 1947.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Townsend, pp. 229–232, 247–265</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> George relinquished the title of [[Emperor of India]], and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead. In 1950 he ceased to be King of India when it became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, but he remained King of Pakistan until his death and India recognised his new title of [[Head of the Commonwealth]]. Other countries left the Commonwealth, such as [[Burma]] in January 1948, [[British Mandate of Palestine|Palestine]] (divided between [[Israel]] and the Arab states) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Townsend, pp. 267–270</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>
