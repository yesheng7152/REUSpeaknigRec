The '''Fin Whale''' (''Balaenoptera physalus''), also called the '''Finback Whale''' or '''Razorback''' or '''Common Rorqual''', is a marine [[mammal]] belonging to the suborder of [[baleen whale]]s. It is the second largest whale and the second largest living animal after the [[Blue Whale]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;marinebio&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web|url=http://marinebio.org/species.asp?id=40|title=''Balaenoptera physalus'' Fin Whale|publisher=MarineBio.org|accessdate=2006-10-23}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> growing to nearly 27&amp;nbsp;[[metre]]s (88&amp;nbsp;[[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) long.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;marinebio&quot;</attr></ext>

Long and slender, the Fin Whale's body is brownish-gray with a paler underside. There are at least two distinct subspecies: the Northern Fin Whale of the North Atlantic, and the larger Antarctic Fin Whale of the [[Southern Ocean]]. It is found in all the world's major oceans, from [[polar region|polar]] to [[tropical]] waters. It is absent only from waters close to the [[ice pack]] at both the [[North pole|north]] and [[South pole|south]] poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean. The highest population density occurs in [[temperate]] and cool waters.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;nmfs&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book|author=National Marine Fisheries Service | year = 2006 | title=Draft recovery plan for the fin whale (''Balaenoptera physalus'')| publisher = National Marine Fisheries Service | location = Silver Spring, Maryland | url=http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/pr/pdfs/recovery/draft_finwhale.pdf | format = pdf}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>
Its food consists of small schooling fish, [[squid]] and [[crustacean]]s including [[Mysidacea|mysids]] and [[krill]].

Like all other large whales, the Fin Whale was heavily hunted during the twentieth century and is an [[endangered species]]. The [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) has issued a moratorium on commercial hunting of this whale,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url = http://www.iwcoffice.org/conservation/rms.htm | title = Revised Management Scheme | publisher = [[International Whaling Commission]] | accessdate = 2006-11-07}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> although [[Iceland]] and [[Japan]] have announced intentions to resume hunting, the latter country stating it will kill a quota of 50 whales for the 2008 season. Collisions with ships and noise from human activity are also significant threats to the recovery of the species.

The Fin Whale has long been known to [[taxonomist]]s, first described by Frederick Martens in 1675 and then again by [[Paul Dudley]] in 1725.

[[Image:Fin whale dorsal fin.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Fin Whale dorsal fin]]

The Fin Whale is usually distinguished by its great length and slender build. The average size of males and females is 19 and 20&amp;nbsp;metres (62 and 66&amp;nbsp;ft), respectively. Subspecies in the [[northern hemisphere]] are known to reach lengths of up to 24&amp;nbsp;metres (79&amp;nbsp;ft), and the Antarctic subspecies reaches lengths of up to 26.8&amp;nbsp;metres (88&amp;nbsp;ft).<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;marinebio&quot;</attr></ext> A full-sized adult has never been weighed, but calculations suggest that a 25&amp;nbsp;metre (82&amp;nbsp;ft) animal could weigh as much as 70,000&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram]]s (154,000&amp;nbsp;[[pound (mass)|lb]]).

[[Image:Fin whale head shot.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A view of the Fin Whale's distinctive paired blowholes]]
The Fin Whale has a brownish grey top and sides and a whitish underside. It has a pointed snout, paired [[Blowhole (biology)|blowholes]], and a broad, flat [[rostrum]]. Two lighter-coloured [[Chevron (insigne)|chevrons]] begin midline behind the blowholes and slant down the sides toward the tail on a diagonal upward to the [[dorsal fin]], sometimes re-curving forward on the back.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;marinebio&quot;</attr></ext> It has a large white patch on the right side of the lower jaw, while the left side of the jaw is grey or black.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;ADW&quot;</attr></ext> This type of [[asymmetry]] can be seen occasionally in [[Minke Whale]]s, but the Fin Whale's asymmetry is universal and thus is unique among [[cetaceans]] and is one of the keys to making a full identification. It was [[Hypothesis|hypothesized]] to have evolved because the whale swims on its right side when surface lunging and it often circles to the right while at the surface above a prey patch. However, the whales just as often circle to the left. There is no accepted hypothesis to explain the asymmetry.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Cite journal|author=Tershy, B. R.|coauthors=D.

The whale has a series of 56 – 100 [[pleat]]s or grooves along the bottom of the body that run from the tip of the [[chin]] to the [[navel]] that allow the throat area to expand greatly during feeding. It has a curved, prominent (60&amp;nbsp;[[centimetre|cm]], 24 [[inch|in]]) dorsal fin about three-quarters of the way along the back. Its [[Flipper (anatomy)|flippers]] are small and tapered, and its tail is wide, pointed at the tip, and notched in the centre.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;marinebio&quot;</attr></ext>

When the whale surfaces, the dorsal fin is visible soon after the spout. The spout is vertical and narrow and can reach heights of 6&amp;nbsp;metres.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;ADW&quot;</attr></ext> The whale will blow one to several times on each visit to the surface, staying close to the surface for about one and a half [[minute]]s each time. The tail remains submerged during the surfacing sequence. It then dives to depths of up to 250&amp;nbsp;metres (820&amp;nbsp;ft), each dive lasting between 10 and 15 minutes. Fin Whales have been known to [[whale surfacing behaviour|leap]] completely out of the water.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;ADW&quot;</attr></ext>

<h level="3" i="3">===Life history===</h>
[[Mating]] occurs in temperate, low-latitude seas during the winter, and the [[gestation period]] is eleven months to one year. A newborn [[wean]]s from its mother at 6 or 7 months of age when it is 11 or 12&amp;nbsp;metres (36 to 39&amp;nbsp;ft) in length, and the [[calf]] follows the mother to the winter feeding ground. Females reproduce every 2 to 3 years, with as many as 6 [[foetus]]es being reported, but single births are far more common. Females reach sexual maturity at between 3 and 12 years of age.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;ADW&quot;</attr></ext>

It then closes its jaws and pushes the water back out of its mouth through its [[baleen]], which allows the water to leave while trapping the prey. An adult has between 262 and 473 baleen plates on each side of the mouth. Each plate is made of [[keratin]] that frays out into fine hairs on the ends inside the mouth near the tongue. Each plate can measure up to 76&amp;nbsp;centimetres (30&amp;nbsp;inches) in length and 30&amp;nbsp;centimetres (12&amp;nbsp;inches) in width.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;marinebio&quot;</attr></ext> The whale routinely dives to depths of more than 200&amp;nbsp;metres (650&amp;nbsp;ft), where it executes an average of four &quot;lunges&quot;, where it feeds on aggregations of krill.

When Fin Whale sounds were first recorded, researchers did not realize that these unusually loud, long, pure, and regular sounds were being made by whales. They first investigated the possibilities that the sounds were due to equipment malfunction, [[geophysical]] phenomena, or part of a [[Soviet Union]] scheme for detecting enemy submarines. Eventually, biologists demonstrated that the sounds were the vocalizations of Fin Whales.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Payne</attr></ext>

[[Image:Fin whale from air.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Fin Whales may reach lengths of up to 26.8 metres (88 ft).]]
Like many of the large rorquals, the Fin Whale is a [[cosmopolitan species]]. It is found in all the world's major oceans, and in waters ranging from the [[polar]] to the tropical. It is absent only from waters close to the [[ice pack]] at both the north and south extremities and relatively small areas of water away from the large oceans, such as the [[Red Sea]], the [[Persian Gulf]], the eastern part of the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Baltic Sea]]. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. It is less densely populated in the hottest, [[equator]]ial regions. It prefers deep waters beyond the [[continental shelf]] to shallow waters.

The North Atlantic Fin Whale has an extensive distribution, occurring from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]], northward to the edges of the Arctic ice pack. In general, Fin Whales are more common north of approximately 30°N [[latitude]], but considerable confusion arises about their occurrence south of 30°N latitude because of the difficulty in distinguishing Fin Whales from Bryde's Whales.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;mead&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite journal | author = Mead, J.G. | year = 1977 | journal = Rep. int.

The lack of understanding of the migration pattern of the Fin Whale combined with population surveys that are often contradictory makes estimating the historical and current population levels of the whale difficult and contentious. Due to a long [[History of whaling|history of hunting]] this whale, pre-exploitation population levels are difficult or impossible to accurately determine, yet estimates are important to measure the rate of recovery of the species.

In the North Atlantic, Fin Whales are defined by the [[International Whaling Commission]] to exist in one of seven discrete population zones: [[Nova Scotia]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]-[[Labrador]], [[West Greenland]], [[East Greenland]]-[[Iceland]], North [[Norway]], West Norway-[[Faroe Islands]], and [[British Isles]]-[[Spain]]-[[Portugal]].

In the 19th century, the Fin Whale was occasionally hunted by the sailing-vessel [[whaling|whalers]], but it was relatively safe because of its quick speed and the fact that it prefers the open sea. However, the introduction of steam-powered boats in the second half of that century and [[harpoon]]s that exploded on impact made it possible to kill and secure Blue Whales, Fin Whales, and Sei Whales on an industrial scale. As other whale species became over-hunted, the whaling industry turned to the still-abundant Fin Whale as a substitute.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;acs&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web| url=http://www.acsonline.org/factpack/finwhl.htm| title=American Cetacean Society Fact Sheet: Fin Whale, ''Balaenoptera physalus''| publisher=American Cetacean Society| accessdate=2006-10-23}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> It was primarily hunted for its [[blubber]], [[whale oil|oil]], and baleen.

The Fin Whale is hunted in the Northern Hemisphere in [[Greenland]], under the International Whaling Commission's procedure for aboriginal subsistence whaling. Meat and other products from whales killed in these hunts are widely marketed within the Greenland economy, but export is illegal.
