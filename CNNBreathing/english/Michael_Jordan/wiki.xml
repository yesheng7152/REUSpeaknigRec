After a three-season career at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he was a member of the Tar Heels' [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|national championship]] team in 1982, Jordan joined the NBA's [[Chicago Bulls]] in [[1984 NBA Draft|1984]]. He quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring. His leaping ability, illustrated by performing [[slam dunk]]s from the [[free throw line]] in [[slam dunk contest]]s, earned him the nicknames &quot;'''Air Jordan'''&quot; and &quot;'''His Airness'''&quot;. He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;defensive players&quot;</attr></ext> In [[1991 NBA Finals|1991]], he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in [[1992 NBA Finals|1992]] and [[1993 NBA Finals|1993]], securing a &quot;[[three-peat]]&quot;. Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball at the beginning of the [[1993–94 NBA season]] to pursue a career in baseball, he rejoined the Bulls in [[1995–96 NBA season|1995]] and led them to three additional championships ([[1996 NBA Finals|1996]], [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]], and [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]]) as well as an NBA-record [[List of NBA teams by single season win percentage|72 regular-season wins]] in the 1995–96 NBA season. Jordan retired for a second time in [[1998–99 NBA season|1999]], but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the [[Washington Wizards]].

Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include five [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] awards, ten [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First Team designations, nine [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive]] First Team honors, fourteen [[NBA All-Star Game]] appearances, three All-Star Game [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] awards, ten [[List of National Basketball Association season scoring leaders|scoring titles]], three [[steal (basketball)|steals]] titles, six [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP awards]], and the 1988 [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]. He holds the NBA records for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by [[ESPN]], and was second to [[Babe Ruth]] on the [[Associated Press]]'s list of athletes of the century. He was inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

Jordan is also noted for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike's]] [[Air Jordan]] sneakers, which were introduced in 1985 and remain popular today.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;remain popular&quot;</attr></ext> Jordan also starred in the 1996 feature film ''[[Space Jam]]'' as himself. He is the majority owner and head of basketball operations for the NBA's [[Charlotte Bobcats]], having won a bidding war to buy controlling interest in the team from founding owner [[Robert L. Johnson]].

<h level="2" i="1">== Early years ==</h>
[[File:Michael Jordan UNC Jersey cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Michael Jordan's jersey in the rafters of The [[Dean Smith Center]]]]
Jordan was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, the son of Deloris (née Peoples), who worked in banking, and [[James R. Jordan, Sr.]], an equipment supervisor. His family moved to [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], North Carolina, when he was a toddler.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;a toddler&quot;</attr></ext> Jordan attended [[Emsley A. Laney High School]] in Wilmington, where he anchored his athletic career by playing baseball, [[American football|football]], and basketball. He tried out for the [[varsity team|varsity]] basketball team during his [[Tenth grade|sophomore]] year, but at 5'11&quot; (1.80&amp;nbsp;m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend, [[Harvest Smith|Harvest Leroy Smith]], was the only sophomore to make the team.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;halb&quot;</attr></ext>

Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's [[junior varsity]] squad, and tallied several 40-point games.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=halb</attr></ext> The following summer, he grew four inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm)<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;nbah&quot;</attr></ext> and trained rigorously. Upon earning a spot on the varsity [[roster]], Jordan averaged about 20 points per game over his final two seasons of high school play.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;br&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;BB&quot;</attr></ext> As a [[Twelfth grade|senior]], he was selected to the [[McDonald's All-American Team]]<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;McDonald's&quot;</attr></ext> after averaging a [[triple-double]]: 29.2 points, 11.6 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], and 10.1 [[assist (basketball)|assists]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;triple-double&quot;</attr></ext>

In 1981, Jordan earned a basketball scholarship to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he [[College major|majored]] in [[cultural geography]]. As a freshman in coach [[Dean Smith]]'s team-oriented system, he was named [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 [[points per game]] (ppg) on 53.4% shooting ([[field goal percentage]]).<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;dbb&quot;</attr></ext> He made the game-winning jump shot in the [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament#Championship game|1982 NCAA Championship]] game against [[Georgetown Hoyas|Georgetown]], which was led by future NBA rival [[Patrick Ewing]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;nbah&quot;</attr></ext> Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>qtd. in Lazenby, Roland. &quot;Michaelangelo: Portrait of a Champion&quot;.

After winning the [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith]] and the [[John R. Wooden Award|Wooden]] College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the [[1984 NBA Draft]]. The [[Chicago Bulls]] selected Jordan with the third overall pick, after [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] ([[Houston Rockets]]) and [[Sam Bowie]] ([[Portland Trail Blazers]]).

Jordan's final NBA game was on April 16, 2003 in [[Philadelphia]]. After scoring only 13 points in the game, Jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds remaining in the third quarter and with his team trailing the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], 75–56.
