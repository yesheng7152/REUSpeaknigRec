After a three-season career at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he was a member of the Tar Heels' [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|national championship]] team in 1982, Jordan joined the NBA's [[Chicago Bulls]] in [[1984 NBA Draft|1984]]. He quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring. His leaping ability, illustrated by performing [[slam dunk]]s from the [[free throw line]] in [[slam dunk contest]]s, earned him the nicknames "'''Air Jordan'''" and "'''His Airness'''". He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball.<ref name="defensive players"/> In [[1991 NBA Finals|1991]], he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in [[1992 NBA Finals|1992]] and [[1993 NBA Finals|1993]], securing a "[[three-peat]]". Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball at the beginning of the [[1993–94 NBA season]] to pursue a career in baseball, he rejoined the Bulls in [[1995–96 NBA season|1995]] and led them to three additional championships ([[1996 NBA Finals|1996]], [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]], and [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]]) as well as an NBA-record [[List of NBA teams by single season win percentage|72 regular-season wins]] in the 1995–96 NBA season. Jordan retired for a second time in [[1998–99 NBA season|1999]], but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the [[Washington Wizards]].

Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include five [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] awards, ten [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First Team designations, nine [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive]] First Team honors, fourteen [[NBA All-Star Game]] appearances, three All-Star Game [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] awards, ten [[List of National Basketball Association season scoring leaders|scoring titles]], three [[steal (basketball)|steals]] titles, six [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP awards]], and the 1988 [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]. He holds the NBA records for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by [[ESPN]], and was second to [[Babe Ruth]] on the [[Associated Press]]'s list of athletes of the century. He was inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

Jordan is also noted for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike's]] [[Air Jordan]] sneakers, which were introduced in 1985 and remain popular today.<ref name="remain popular"/> Jordan also starred in the 1996 feature film ''[[Space Jam]]'' as himself. He is the majority owner and head of basketball operations for the NBA's [[Charlotte Bobcats]], having won a bidding war to buy controlling interest in the team from founding owner [[Robert L. Johnson]].

== Early years ==
[[File:Michael Jordan UNC Jersey cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Michael Jordan's jersey in the rafters of The [[Dean Smith Center]]]]
Jordan was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, the son of Deloris (née Peoples), who worked in banking, and [[James R. Jordan, Sr.]], an equipment supervisor. His family moved to [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], North Carolina, when he was a toddler.<ref name="a toddler"/> Jordan attended [[Emsley A. Laney High School]] in Wilmington, where he anchored his athletic career by playing baseball, [[American football|football]], and basketball. He tried out for the [[varsity team|varsity]] basketball team during his [[Tenth grade|sophomore]] year, but at 5'11" (1.80&nbsp;m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend, [[Harvest Smith|Harvest Leroy Smith]], was the only sophomore to make the team.<ref name="halb"/>

Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's [[junior varsity]] squad, and tallied several 40-point games.<ref name=halb/> The following summer, he grew four inches (10&nbsp;cm)<ref name="nbah"/> and trained rigorously. Upon earning a spot on the varsity [[roster]], Jordan averaged about 20 points per game over his final two seasons of high school play.<ref name="br"/><ref name="BB"/> As a [[Twelfth grade|senior]], he was selected to the [[McDonald's All-American Team]]<ref name="McDonald's"/> after averaging a [[triple-double]]: 29.2 points, 11.6 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], and 10.1 [[assist (basketball)|assists]].<ref name="triple-double"/>

In 1981, Jordan earned a basketball scholarship to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he [[College major|majored]] in [[cultural geography]]. As a freshman in coach [[Dean Smith]]'s team-oriented system, he was named [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 [[points per game]] (ppg) on 53.4% shooting ([[field goal percentage]]).<ref name="dbb"/> He made the game-winning jump shot in the [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament#Championship game|1982 NCAA Championship]] game against [[Georgetown Hoyas|Georgetown]], which was led by future NBA rival [[Patrick Ewing]].<ref name="nbah"/> Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.<ref>qtd. in Lazenby, Roland. "Michaelangelo: Portrait of a Champion". ''Michael Jordan: The Ultimate Career Tribute''. Bannockburn, IL: H&S Media, 1999. pg. 128.</ref> During his three seasons at North Carolina, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 [[rebounds per game]] (rpg).<ref name="br" />  He was selected by consensus to the [[1983 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|NCAA All-American First Team]] in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons. After winning the [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith]] and the [[John R. Wooden Award|Wooden]] College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the [[1984 NBA Draft]]. The [[Chicago Bulls]] selected Jordan with the third overall pick, after [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] ([[Houston Rockets]]) and [[Sam Bowie]] ([[Portland Trail Blazers]]). Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986.<ref>Morris, Mike. "The Legend: A Highlight-Reel History of the NBA's Greatest Player". ''Michael Jordan: The Ultimate Career Tribute''. Bannockburn, IL: H&S Media, 1999. pg. 67.</ref>

Jordan had recovered completely by the [[1986–87 NBA season|1986–87 season]], and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history. He became the only player other than [[Wilt Chamberlain]] to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league high 37.1 points on 48.2% shooting.<ref name="dbb"/> In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 [[block (basketball)|blocks]] in a season. Despite Jordan's success, [[Magic Johnson]] won the league's [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]]. The Bulls reached 40 wins,<ref name="dbbulls"/> and advanced to [[1987 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] for the third consecutive year.

Jordan had a versatile offensive game.

Jordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. He has been a major spokesman for such brands as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Chevrolet]], [[Gatorade]], [[McDonald's]], [[Ball Park Franks]], [[Rayovac]], [[Wheaties]], [[Hanes]], and [[MCI Communications|MCI]].<ref name="rov">Rovell, Darren.

Nike created a signature shoe for him, called the ''[[Air Jordan]]''. One of Jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved [[Spike Lee]] playing the part of [[Mars Blackmon]]. In the commercials Lee, as Blackmon, attempted to find the source of Jordan's abilities and became convinced that "it's gotta be the shoes".<ref name="rov"/> The hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of "shoe-jackings" where people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. Subsequently Nike spun off the Jordan line into its own division named the "Jordan Brand".
