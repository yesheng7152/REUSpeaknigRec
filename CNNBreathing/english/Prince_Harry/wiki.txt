His paternal grandparents are [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. His stepmother is [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]]. He stands fourth in [[Line of succession to the British throne|line to succeed]] his grandmother as monarch of the [[Commonwealth realm]]s, preceded by his father, elder brother [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge]], and nephew [[Prince George of Cambridge]].

After an education at schools in the United Kingdom and spending parts of his [[gap year]] in [[Australia]] and [[Lesotho]], Harry chose a military career, undergoing officer training at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].

{{British Royal Family}}

His godparents were [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|The Duke of York]] (his paternal uncle); [[Lady Sarah Chatto|Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones]] (his paternal cousin once removed); Lady Vestey; Mrs William Bartholomew; [[Bryan Organ]]; and Gerald Ward, a former officer in the Household Cavalry.<ref name="Yvonne">{{cite web|url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings |title=Royal Christenings|publisher=Yvonne's Royalty Home Page|accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref><ref name="peo14jan">{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Terry|coauthors=Rosemary Thorpe-Tracey|title=A Windsor War|journal=People|date=14 January 1985|volume=23|issue=2|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20089686,00.html|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref>

Diana wanted Harry and his older brother [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William]] to have a broader range of experiences than previous royal children and took them to venues that ranged from [[Walt Disney World|Disney World]] and [[McDonald's]] to AIDS clinics and shelters for the homeless.<ref name="PeopleBio">{{Cite journal|url=http://www.people.com/people/prince_harry/biography|title=Prince Harry|journal=People|accessdate=15 October 2008}}</ref> Harry began to accompany his parents on official visits at an early age; his first overseas royal tour was with his parents to Italy in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/atwork/supportingthequeen/countriesvisited/index.html|title=The Prince of Wales > At Work > Countries Visited|publisher=Clarence House|accessdate=15 October 2008}}</ref>

Harry's parents divorced in 1996, and his mother [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|died following a car accident]] in [[Paris]] the following year. Harry and William were staying with their father at [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] at the time, and the Prince of Wales told his sons about their mother's death.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/conspiracy_files/6217366.stm|title=Timeline: How Diana Died|work=BBC|date=30 August 1997|accessdate=11 April 2008|location=London}}</ref> At his [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|mother's funeral]], Harry, then 12, accompanied his father, brother, paternal grandfather, and [[Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer|maternal uncle, Earl Spencer]] in walking behind the funeral cortège from [[Kensington Palace]] to [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/6/newsid_2502000/2502307.stm|title=BBC ON THIS DAY – 6–1997: Diana's funeral watched by millions|work=BBC|date=6 September 1997|location=London|accessdate=26 March 2009}}</ref>

==Education==

Like his father and brother, Harry was educated at [[independent school (United Kingdom)|independent schools]].

At the age of 21, Harry was appointed as a [[Counsellor of State]] and began his duties in that capacity when the Queen was attending the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2005|2005 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] in Malta. The following year, Harry was in Lesotho to visit again [[Msizi Africa#Mants'ase Children's Home|Mants'ase Children's Home]] near [[Mohale's Hoek]], which he first toured in 2004 and, along with [[Prince Seeiso of Lesotho]], launched [[Sentebale|Sentebale: The Princes' Fund for Lesotho]], a charity to aid children orphaned by HIV/AIDS. He has granted his [[patronage]] to organisations including WellChild, Dolen Cymru, and [[MapAction]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/media/press-releases/prince-harry-become-patron-of-three-charities

</ref> To aid Sentebale, and the [[Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund]] and [[Centrepoint (charity)|Centrepoint]], Harry and his brother organised the [[Concert for Diana]] at [[Wembley Stadium]], on 1 July 2007.

Sport has been a way that Harry has helped charities and other organisations, such as training as a Rugby Development Officer for the [[Rugby Football Union]] in 2004 and coaching students in schools to encourage them to learn the sport. He has participated in [[polo]] matches, like his brother and father, to raise money for charitable causes.<ref name="POWInt" />

On 6 January 2009, the Queen granted Harry and William their own [[Royal Households of the United Kingdom|royal household]]. It has three main staff members, supported by a "small" team. Sir [[David Manning]], the former British ambassador to Washington, is a part-time adviser to the princes. Previously, William and Harry's affairs had been handled by the office of their father at Clarence House in central London. The new household released a statement, complete with their own [[monogram|cypher]]s at the top, announcing that they have established their own office at nearby [[St James's Palace]] to look after their public, military and charitable activities.<ref>{{cite web

Rumours have persisted that Harry might be the son of [[James Hewitt]], with whom his mother had an affair, but this has been refuted by Hewitt and others, who point out that Harry was born before the affair began.{{#tag:ref|The rumours are supposedly based on a similarity of hair colour; however, red hair is a known Spencer family trait.

I can absolutely assure you that I am not…I can understand the interest but Harry was already walking by the time my relationship with Diana began. Admittedly the red hair is similar to mine and people say we look alike. I have never encouraged these comparisons and although I was with Diana for a long time I must state once and for all that I'm not Harry's father."

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==

===Titles and styles===
[[File:Royal Monogram of Prince Harry of Wales.svg|thumb|Prince Harry's monogram]]

Harry's full style and title is ''His Royal Highness Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales'', but he is almost always called Prince Harry. As a [[British prince]] he uses the name of the area over which his father holds title, i.e., ''Wales'', as a territorial suffix in lieu of surname. Past precedent is that such surnames are dropped from usage in adulthood, after which either title alone or [[Mountbatten-Windsor]] is used when necessary.<ref>{{cite web

Traditionally, sons of the reigning monarch and of the Prince of Wales receive a dukedom immediately prior to marriage, the most recent being [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]], who became [[Duke of Cambridge]].
