[[File:Royal Monogram of Prince Harry of Wales.svg|thumb|Prince Harry's monogram]]

Harry's full style and title is ''His Royal Highness Prince Henry Charles Albert David of Wales'', but he is almost always called Prince Harry. As a [[British prince]] he uses the name of the area over which his father holds title, i.e., ''Wales'', as a territorial suffix in lieu of surname. Past precedent is that such surnames are dropped from usage in adulthood, after which either title alone or [[Mountbatten-Windsor]] is used when necessary.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web
