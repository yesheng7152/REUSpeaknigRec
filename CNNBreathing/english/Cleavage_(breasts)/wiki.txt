'''Cleavage''' is the [[wikt:cleft|cleft]] between a [[woman]]'s [[breasts]] lying over the [[sternum]] revealed by a garment with a low [[neckline]]. It is associated with low-cut women's [[clothing]], such as [[evening gown]]s, [[swimwear]], casual tops and other garments, designed to emphasize the display of breasts.

Some people regard use of cleavage as a form of feminine [[flirting]] or [[seduction]], within the confines of community, [[peer group]] and personal standards of [[modesty]], as much as for its [[aesthetic]] or [[erotic]] effect. Many women use cleavage to enhance their [[sexual attractiveness]]. Some people derive erotic pleasure from seeing a woman's cleavage, some derive pleasure in their female partner's exposing her cleavage, and some women expose their cleavage for the pleasure of their partner. 

==Cleavage terms==
'''Décolletage''' (or ''décolleté'', its adjectival form, in current [[French language|French]]) is cleavage produced by a low-cut [[neckline]] that exposes the neck, shoulders and parts of the breasts, but not the [[nipple]]. In strict usage the term denoted the neckline, the zone extending about two
handbreadths from the base of the neck down, obverse and recto.<ref>Bernard Rudofsky. ''The unfashionable human body‎'', page 62, Doubleday, 1971.</ref> Only after the [[French Revolution]] did the décolletage become larger in the front and smaller in the back.<ref>S. Devadas Pillai. ''Indian sociology through Ghurye, a dictionary'', page 68, Popular Prakashan, 1997, ISBN 8171548075.</ref>

The [[International Federation of Associations of Anatomists]] (IFAA) has adopted the terms '''intermammary sulcus''' or '''intermammary cleft''' when referring to the area of cleavage between the breasts not including the breasts. For legal purpose it was noted by the [[United States federal courts]] that "[[Buttock cleavage|anal cleft or cleavage]]" and "cleavage of the female breast" are so imprecise as to provide no guidance in defining them.<ref>West's federal supplement (First Series), p. 994, West Publishing Co, 1990.</ref>

===Lateral===
When the lateral aspects of the breasts are uncovered, it is known as ''side cleavage'', ''sidewinders'' or ''sideboob''.<ref name=Dun>Elizabeth Dunlap, "[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-33410288_ITM The glossary: can't pronounce the ingredient, the makeup artist's name, or even the product?

===Underside===
Exposure of the underside of the breast, such as below an extremely short [[crop top]], is known as ''neathage'', ''Australian cleavage'' (because of the reference to Australia as down-under), ''bottom cleavage'', ''reverse cleavage'' or ''underboob''.<ref name=Dun/><ref name=lot/> It is referred to by the term ''shitapai'' ([[wiktionary:shita|shita]]+[[wiktionary:oppai|oppai]]: under-breasts) in Japanese.<ref>[http://www.sankakucomplex.com/2009/01/09/shitapai-gallery ''Shitapai by Sankaku''], Jan 9, 2009.</ref>

==History==

In European society, décolletage was often displayed in the dress of the late [[Middle Ages]]. This continued through the Victorian period. [[Corset]]s that enhance the cleavage were introduced in the mid 16th century.<ref>Jill Condra. ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through World History'', page 152, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, ISBN 0313336644.</ref> By the late 18th century these cleavage enhancing corsets grew more dramatic in pushing the breasts upwards.<ref>Catherine Spooner. ''Fashioning gothic bodies'', Page 28, Manchester University Press, 2004, ISBN 0719064015.</ref>
It is a feature of the [[evening gown]], [[leotard]], and [[bikini]], among other fashions. In the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], there was a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift to be offered from mother to child. In Moissy's play ''The True Mother'', the title character rebukes her husband for treating her merely an object for his sexual gratification: "Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts &ndash; the respectable treasures of nature &ndash; as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?"<ref>Simon Schama. ''Citizens. A Chronicle of the French Revolution'', p. 147. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1989. ISBN 0-394-559-48-7.</ref> Nearly a century later, also in France, a man from the provinces who attended a Court ball at the [[Tuilleries]] in [[Paris]] in 1855 was deeply shocked by the décolleté dresses and is said to have exclaimed in disgust: "I haven't seen anything like that since I was weaned!"<ref>Alison Gernsheim. ''Victorian and Edwardian Fashion. A Photographic Survey'', p. 43. Mineola, N.Y.: Dover Publications, Inc., 1981. Reprint of 1963 edition. ISBN 0-486-24205-6.</ref>

For ordinary wear, high collars were, however, the norm for many years. When it became fashionable, around 1913, for dresses to be worn with a modest round or V-shaped neckline, this nonetheless deeply shocked [[clergymen]] all over the world. In the [[German Empire]], all of the [[Roman Catholic]] bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking modern fashions.<ref>Gernsheim,  94.</ref> Fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage, while exposure of the leg became more permitted in Western societies, during [[World War I]] and remained so for nearly half a century.<ref>Kim K. P. Johnson, Susan J. Torntore, and Joanne Bubolz Eicher. ''Fashion foundations'', page 716, Berg Publishers, 2003, ISBN 185973619X.</ref> From the 1960s onward, however, changing social mores allowed a greater display of cleavage in films, on television, and in everyday life.

[[Lingerie]] has long been designed to emphasize cleavage. The tight lacing of corsets worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries emphasized both cleavage and the size of the bust and hips. Ball or evening gowns especially were designed to display and emphasize the décolletage.<ref>Gernsheim, pp. 25-26, 43, 53, 63.</ref><ref>Desmond Morris. ''The Naked Woman. A Study of the Female Body'', p. 156. New York: Thomas Dunne Books, 2004. ISBN 0-312-33853-8.</ref> More recently, after corsets became unfashionable, [[brassiere]]s and padding have served to project, display and emphasize the breasts, as has breast augmentation surgery.

==Cleavage theory==
{{Quote box
 | quote  = I interviewed a young anthropologist working with women in Mali, in a country in Africa where women go around with bare breasts. They're always feeding their babies. And when she told them that in our culture men are fascinated with breasts there was an instant of shock. The women burst out laughing. They laughed so hard, they fell on the floor. They said,  "You mean, men act like babies?"

[[United Kingdom|British]] [[zoologist]] and [[ethologist]] [[Desmond Morris]] theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the [[Buttock cleavage|cleft between the buttocks]],<ref>Desmond Morris. ''Manwatching. A Field Guide to Human Behavior.''. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1977. ISBN 0-8109-1310-0.</ref> which according to Morris in ''[[The Naked Ape]]'' is also unique to humans, other primates as a rule having much flatter buttocks.

[[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] theorize that humans' permanently enlarged breasts, in contrast to other primates' breasts, which only enlarge during [[ovulation]], allowed females to "solicit male attention and investment even when they are not really fertile",<ref>Charles B. Crawford and Dennis Krebs (eds.). "How Mate Choice Shaped Human Nature", ''Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology: Ideas, Issues, and Applications'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates (1998).</ref> though Morris notes that in recent years there has been a trend toward reversing breast augmentations.<ref>Morris. ''Manwatching'', pp. 236, 240.</ref><ref>Morris. ''Naked Woman'', pp. 156-159.</ref> Several brassiere manufacturers, among them [[Wonderbra]] and [[Victoria's Secret]], have become known for marketing products that enhance the décolletage. On the first Friday of April in [[South Africa]], Wonderbra sponsors a [[National Cleavage Day]].<ref name=WONDERBRA>[http://www.wonderbra.co.za/nationalcleavageday.aspx National Cleavage Day] ''Wonderbra.co.za''.</ref> According to social historian David Kunzle, waist confinement and the décolletage are the primary [[sexualization]] devices of Western costume.<ref>Jennifer Craik.

==Cultural aspects==
{{See also| Dress code}}

In Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much cleavage exposure is acceptable in public.<ref>Salmansohn, Karen. "[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-salmansohn/the_power_of_cleavage_b_70260.html The Power of Cleavage]". ''The Huffington Post'', October 29, 2007.</ref> In contemporary Western society, the extent to which a woman may expose her breasts depends on social and cultural context. Women's [[swimsuit]]s and [[bikini]]s commonly reveal the tops and sides of the breasts. Displaying cleavage is considered permissible in many settings, and is even a sign of elegance and sophistication on many formal social occasions, but it may be prohibited by [[dress code]]s in settings such as workplaces and schools, where any display of the female breast may be considered inappropriate. Showing the nipples or areolae is almost always considered [[toplessness]] or partial [[nudity]].

===Controversy===
In the United States, in two separate incidents in 2007, [[Southwest Airlines]] crews asked travelers to modify their clothing, to wear sweaters, or to leave the plane because they did not consider the amount of cleavage displayed to be acceptable.<ref> NBC News.
