'''4chan''' is an [[English language|English-language]] [[imageboard]] [[website]]. Launched on October 1, 2003, its boards are primarily used for the posting of pictures and discussion of [[manga]] and [[anime]]. Users generally post anonymously and the site has been linked to Internet [[subculture]]s and [[activism]], most notably [[Project Chanology]].

4chan users have been responsible for the formation or popularization of [[Internet meme]]s such as [[lolcat]]s, [[Rickrolling]], "[[Chocolate Rain]]", "[[Pedobear]]", and many others. The site's random board is by far its most popular and notorious feature. Known as "/b/", there are very minimal rules on posted content. [[Gawker]] once jokingly claimed that "reading /b/ will melt your brain".<ref name="Gawker" />

The site's [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] community and culture have often provoked media attention. For [[media planner|planners]], this enterprise is "further proof that creativity is everywhere and [[new media]] is less accessible" to [[advertising agency|advertisement agencies]].<ref>{{Cite news|author=Unattributed|title=It's all about the money, stupid, not the latest online technology|newspaper=[[Marketing Week]]|page=13|date=2008-08-07|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8246737/It-s-all-about-the.html|accessdate=2009-02-04|postscript=<!--None-->}}</ref> Journalists looked at how an Internet destination was hijacked for a prank, so that images of [[Rick Astley]] appeared instead of the page that was searched for; the coordination of attacks against other websites and Internet users; and covered the reaction to threats of violence that have been posted on the site. ''[[The Guardian]]'' once summarised the 4chan community as "lunatic, juvenile... brilliant, ridiculous and alarming."<ref name="TakingRick" />

==Background==
4chan was started in 2003 in the bedroom of a 15-year old student from New York City who posts as "moot".<ref name="wsj" /> He intended the site to be a place to discuss [[manga|Japanese comic]]s and [[anime]], an American counterpart to the popular Japanese [[Futaba Channel]] ("2chan") imageboard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2008/0502/1209632797289.html|title=Tuning into innovation outside the confines of English-speaking web|publisher=''[[The Irish Times|Irish Times]]''|date=2008-05-02|author=Danny O'Brien|accessdate=2009-01-17}}</ref><ref name="what4chan" /> Prior to starting 4chan, moot had been a regular participant on the [[Something Awful]] [[Internet forum|forums]].<ref name=TheStar />

The activity of 4chan takes place on [[Internet forum|message board]]s and [[imageboard]]s.<ref name="Gawker" /><ref name="what4chan">{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#what4chan|title=FAQ&nbsp;– What is 4chan?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> The website is split into six categories: [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]], Interests, Creative, Adult (18+), Other, and Misc (18+). These provide for on-topic boards to discuss [[anime]], [[manga]], [[technology]], [[sport]], [[photography]], [[music]], [[hentai]], [[BitTorrent (protocol)|torrent]]s, [[travel]], [[physical fitness]], as well as a [[#/b/|random]] board. 4chan originally hosted discussion boards on a separate domain called "world4ch", but these were later moved to the dis.4chan.org subdomain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#were|title=FAQ&nbsp;– What were 4channel and world4ch?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> The site has had at least one employee, a [[programmer]] whom moot met via on-line ''[[Tetris]]''. All other [[Internet forum|moderators]] are volunteers.<ref name="wsj" />

4chan is one of the Internet's most trafficked imageboards, according to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref name="swat" /> 4chan's [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] rank is generally around 700,<ref name="Alexa">{{cite web|url=http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main/4chan.org|title=4chan.org&nbsp;— Site Information|publisher=[[Alexa Internet|Alexa]]|accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> though it has been as high as number 56 at times.<ref name="landers" /> It is provided to its users free of charge and consumes a large amount of [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]; as a result, its financing has often been problematic. moot acknowledges that donations alone cannot keep the site on-line, so he has turned to advertising to help make ends meet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/news.php?all#95|title=The long and short of it|publisher=4chan| author=moot| date=2008-02-12|accessdate=2008-08-02}}</ref> However, the explicit content hosted on 4chan has deterred businesses who do not want to be associated with the site's content.<ref name="time" /> In January 2009, moot signed a new deal with an advertising company; {{asof|2009|2|lc=1}}, he was $20,000 in debt and the site was continuing to lose money.<ref name="WP-17Feb09">{{cite news|last=Hesse|first=Monica|title=A Virtual Unknown; Meet 'Moot,' the Secretive Internet Celeb Who Still Lives With Mom|work=[[The Washington Post]]|pages=23–24|date=2009-02-17|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/16/AR2009021601565.html|accessdate=2009-04-16}}</ref>

Unlike most web forums, 4chan does not have a registration system, allowing users to post [[anonymity|anonymously]].<ref name="TheStar">{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/living/article/257955|title=Funny how `stupid' site is addictive|publisher=''[[Toronto Star|The Toronto Star]]''|author=Jerry Langton|date=2007-09-22|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#postanon|title=FAQ&nbsp;– How do I post anonymously?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> Any nickname may be used when posting, even one that has been previously adopted, such as "Anonymous" or "moot".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#register|title=FAQ&nbsp;– Can I register a username?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> In place of registration, 4chan has provided [[tripcode]]s as an optional form of authenticating a poster's identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#trip|title=FAQ&nbsp;– How do I use a "tripcode"?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> As making a post without filling in the "Name" field causes posts to be attributed to "Anonymous", general understanding on 4chan holds that Anonymous is not a single person but a collective ([[Beehive symbolism|hive]]) of users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#anonymous|title=FAQ&nbsp;– Who is "Anonymous"?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> Moderators generally post without a name even when performing [[sysop]] actions. A "capcode" may be used to attribute the post to "Anonymous ## Mod", although moderators often post without the capcode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#capcode|title=FAQ&nbsp;– What is a capcode?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2008-07-16}}</ref> 4chan also has a junior moderation team, called "janitors", who may delete posts or images and suggest that the normal moderation team ban a user, but who can not post with a capcode. Revealing oneself as a janitor is grounds for immediate dismissal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq#whojan| title=FAQ&nbsp;– What are "janitors"?|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2009-01-12}}</ref>

==Links to Anonymous and Project Chanology==
{{See also|Anonymous (group)|Project Chanology}}
4chan has been labeled as the starting point of the [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] meme by The ''[[Baltimore City Paper]]'',<ref name="landers">{{cite news| author =Chris Landers| title =Serious Business| work =[[Baltimore City Paper]]| date =2008-03-02| url =http://www.citypaper.com/columns/story.asp?id=15543| accessdate = 2008-07-13}}</ref> due to the norm of posts signed with the "Anonymous" moniker. The ''[[National Post]]''{{'}}s David George-Cosh said it has been "widely reported" that Anonymous is associated with 4chan and [[Imageboard|711chan]], as well as numerous [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC) channels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/story.html?id=db57d8d2-ca06-4fe0-8a8b-4975100f7231|title=Online group declares war on Scientology|publisher=[[National Post]]|author=David George-Cosh|date=2008-01-25|accessdate=2008-07-13}}</ref>

Through its association with Anonymous, 4chan has become associated with [[Project Chanology]], a worldwide protest against the [[Church of Scientology]] held by members of Anonymous. On January 15, 2008, a 4chan user posted to /b/, suggesting participants "do something big" against the Church of Scientology's website. This message resulted in the Church receiving, by its own reports, more than 6,000 threatening phone calls. It quickly grew into a large real-world protest. Unlike previous Anonymous attacks, this action was characterized by 4chan [[meme]]s including [[rickrolling|rickroll]]s and [[Guy Fawkes]] masks. The raid drew criticism from some 4chan users who felt it would bring the site undesirable attention.<ref name="landers" />

==/b/==
The "[[random]]" board, /b/, follows the design of Futaba Channel's Nijiura board. It was the first board created, and is by far 4chan's most popular board, with 30% of site traffic.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fimoculous.com/archive/post-5738.cfm | title = An Interview With The Founder of 4chan | last = Sorgatz | first = Rex | publisher = Fimoculous.com | date = 2009-02-18 | accessdate = 2009-05-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/news.php?all#101|title=/b/|publisher=4chan|author=moot|date=2008-07-11|accessdate=2008-07-14}}</ref> [[Gawker.com]]'s Nick Douglas summarized /b/ as a board where "people try to shock, entertain, and coax free porn from each other."<ref name="Gawker">{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/346385/what-the-hell-are-4chan-ed-something-awful-and-b|title=What The Hell Are 4chan, ED, Something Awful, And "b"?|publisher=[[Gawker.com]]|author=Nick Douglas|date=2008-01-18|accessdate=2008-07-15}}</ref> /b/ has a "no rules" policy, except for bans on certain illegal content, such as [[child pornography]], invasions of other websites, and under-18 viewing, all of which are inherited from site-wide rules. The "no invasions" rule was added in late 2006, after /b/ users spent most of the summer "invading" [[Habbo|Habbo Hotel]]. The "no rules" policy also applies to actions of administrator and moderator, which means that users may be banned at any time, for any reason, including no reason at all.<ref name="4chanTOS">{{cite web| url=http://www.4chan.org/rules.php#b|title=4chan&nbsp;— Rules&nbsp;– /b/ - Random|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2006-08-18}}</ref> Due partially to its anonymous nature, board moderation is not always successful—indeed, the site's anti-child pornography rule is a subject of jokes on /b/.<ref name="landers" /> moot told ''[[The New York Times]]'', in a discussion on the moderation of /b/, that "the power lies in the community to dictate its own standards" and that site staff simply provided a framework.<ref name="nyt" />

Each post is assigned a post number. Certain post numbers are sought after with a large amount of posting taking place to "GET" them. A "GET" occurs when a post's number ends in a special number, such as 12345678, 22222222, or every millionth post.<ref name="faqget">{{cite web|url=http://www.4chan.org/faq.php#get|title=FAQ on GETs|publisher=4chan|accessdate=2007-03-14}}</ref> A sign of 4chan's scaling, according to moot, was when GETs lost meaning due to the high post rate resulting in a GET occurring every few weeks. moot estimated /b/'s post rate in July 2008 to be 150,000–200,000 posts per day.<ref name="blog" />

==Memes==
[[Internet meme]]s are catchphrases or images that spread quickly, [[peer-to-peer (meme)|peer to peer]], across the Internet.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2000/aug/10/technology|title=It's all in the memes|publisher=Guardian|author=Karl Hodge|date=2000-08-10|accessdate=2008-09-13 | location=London}}</ref> Many Internet memes have originated on 4chan, usually /b/, as its fast moving, [[crowd psychology]] nature enables content to quickly be passed on to large numbers of viewers. The most noteworthy of these memes are [[lolcat]]s, [[rickrolling]], and "[[Chocolate Rain]]". Other memes originating on the site have gained media attention of a lesser degree. These include "So I herd u liek [[mudkip]]z"{{Sic}}, which involves a phrase based on [[Pokémon]], and which generated numerous YouTube tribute videos.<ref name="TheStar" /> 4chan, and other websites, such as the satirical [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], have also contributed to the development of significant amounts of [[leet]]speak.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article4173635.ece|title=Scientology: the Anonymous protestors|publisher=The Times|author=Caitlin Moran|date=2008-06-20|accessdate=2008-08-25 | location=London}}</ref> In 2005, the [[lolcat]] meme was widely popularized by 4chan in the form of "Caturday".

===Rickrolling===
{{Main|Rickrolling}}
In 2005, a meme known as the "duckroll" began, after moot used a [[Wordfilter|word filter]] to change "egg" to "duck" across 4chan. Thus, words such as "eggroll" were changed to "duckroll". This led to a [[bait-and-switch]] in which external links disguised as relevant to a discussion instead led to a picture of a duck on wheels.<ref name="Fox memes">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352010,00.html|title=The Biggest Little Internet Hoax on Wheels Hits Mainstream|publisher=[[Fox News Channel]]|date=2008-04-22|accessdate=2008-07-24}}</ref>

In March 2007, the [[Marketing for Grand Theft Auto IV|trailer]] for the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' was released. Its immense popularity caused publisher [[Rockstar Games]]' website to [[crash (computing)|crash]]. An unidentified 4chan user applied the concept of the duckroll to what appeared to be a link to the trailer on [[YouTube]], but instead showed the music video for [[Rick Astley]]'s 1987 song "[[Never Gonna Give You Up]]". Thus, the "rickroll" was born.<ref name="Fox memes" /> In an interview with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Astley said he found the meme "bizarre and funny".<ref name="TakingRick">{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/mar/19/news|title=Taking the Rick|publisher=Guardian|author=Sean Michaels|date=2008-03-19|accessdate=2008-07-24 | location=London}}</ref><ref name="Fox memes"/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/webscout/2008/03/rick-astley-kin.html|title=Web Scout exclusive!

==ISP bans==
===AT&T temporary ban===
On July 26, 2009, [[AT&T]]'s [[DSL]] branch temporarily blocked access to the img.4chan.org domain (host of /b/ and /r9k/), which was initially believed to be an attempt at [[Internet censorship]], and met with hostility on 4chan's part.<ref>[http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/26/att-blocks-4chan-this-is-going-to-get-ugly/ AT&T Reportedly Blocks 4chan. This Is Going To Get Ugly.] Jason Kincaid, Tech Crunch, July 26, 2009.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centralgadget.com/att-blocking-access-to-portions-of-4chan-2336/|title=AT&T Blocking Access to Portions of 4chan (Updated Again)|date=2006-07-26|publisher=CentralGadget|accessdate=2006-07-26|work=Christopher Price}}</ref>

On July 27, 2009, AT&T issued a statement claiming that the block was put in place after an AT&T customer was affected by a denial-of-service attack originating from IP addresses connected to img.4chan.org, and was an attempt to "prevent this attack from disrupting service for the impacted AT&T customer, and... our other customers." AT&T maintains that the block was not related to the content on 4chan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2350814,00.asp/|title=AT&T Confirms 4chan Block After DoS Attack|date=2009-07-27|publisher=PC Mag|accessdate=2009-07-27|work=Chloe Albanesius}}</ref>

4chan's founder moot responded with the following:<ref name="4chan Status">{{cite web|url=http://status.4chan.org/index.html#2174049422947602936/|title=4chan Status|date=2009-07-27|accessdate=2009-07-27}}</ref>
<blockquote>In the end, this wasn't a sinister act of censorship, but rather a bit of a mistake and a poorly executed, disproportionate response on AT&T's part. Whoever pulled the trigger on blackholing the site probably didn't anticipate [nor intend] the consequences of doing so.

We're glad to see this short-lived debacle has prompted renewed interest and debate over net neutrality and Internet censorship—two very important issues that don't get nearly enough attention—so perhaps this was all just a blessing in disguise.</blockquote>

Major news outlets have reported that the issue may be related to DDoSing of 4chan and that the suspicions of 4chan users fell on the person who owned Anontalk.com at that time for doing this.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,534941,00.html Feared Hackers Call Off Attack on AT&T. Tuesday, July 28, 2009.] Retrieved 7/28/09</ref> Kimmo Alm has been reported in the past to have DDoSed 4chan.<ref>[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92767742 When Your Pedicurist Is A Fish (dated July 22, 2008)] Transcript of National Public Radio news interview. Retrieved 7/28/09</ref>

Concerning the AT&T claims of DDoS attacks originating from 4chan, moot confirmed it was due to a network error:<ref name="4chan Status"/>
<blockquote>For the past three weeks, 4chan has been under a constant DDoS attack. We were able to filter this specific type of attack in a fashion that was more or less transparent to the end user.

Unfortunately, as an unintended consequence of the method used, some Internet users received errant traffic from one of our network switches. A handful happened to be AT&T customers</blockquote>

===Verizon ban===
On February 4, 2010, 4chan started receiving reports from [[Verizon Wireless]] customers that they were having difficulties accessing the site's image boards. After investigating, moot found out that only traffic on [[TCP and UDP port|port]] 80 to the boards.4chan.org domain was affected, leading members to believe that the block was intentional.<ref>[http://status.4chan.org/index.html#7155425685835498189 Verizon Wireless users are having trouble accessing the site]</ref>
On February 7, 2010, Verizon Wireless confirmed that 4chan was "explicitly blocked".<ref>[http://status.4chan.org/index.html#2310965532000217917 Verizon Wireless confirms block]</ref>  The block was lifted several days later.<ref>[http://wirelessfederation.com/news/21888-verizon-wireless-restores-4chan-traffic-2/ Verizon Wireless restores 4Chan traffic], Wireless Federation, United Kingdom, 2010-02-10, accessed 2010-02-12, "After the concerns were raised over network attacks, Verizon Wireless restored traffic affiliated with the 4chan online forum."</ref>
