'''4chan''' is an [[English language|English-language]] [[imageboard]] [[website]]. Launched on October 1, 2003, its boards are primarily used for the posting of pictures and discussion of [[manga]] and [[anime]]. Users generally post anonymously and the site has been linked to Internet [[subculture]]s and [[activism]], most notably [[Project Chanology]].

4chan users have been responsible for the formation or popularization of [[Internet meme]]s such as [[lolcat]]s, [[Rickrolling]], &quot;[[Chocolate Rain]]&quot;, &quot;[[Pedobear]]&quot;, and many others. The site's random board is by far its most popular and notorious feature. Known as &quot;/b/&quot;, there are very minimal rules on posted content. [[Gawker]] once jokingly claimed that &quot;reading /b/ will melt your brain&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gawker&quot; </attr></ext>

The site's [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] community and culture have often provoked media attention. For [[media planner|planners]], this enterprise is &quot;further proof that creativity is everywhere and [[new media]] is less accessible&quot; to [[advertising agency|advertisement agencies]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Cite news|author=Unattributed|title=It's all about the money, stupid, not the latest online technology|newspaper=[[Marketing Week]]|page=13|date=2008-08-07|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-8246737/It-s-all-about-the.html|accessdate=2009-02-04|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Journalists looked at how an Internet destination was hijacked for a prank, so that images of [[Rick Astley]] appeared instead of the page that was searched for; the coordination of attacks against other websites and Internet users; and covered the reaction to threats of violence that have been posted on the site. ''[[The Guardian]]'' once summarised the 4chan community as &quot;lunatic, juvenile... brilliant, ridiculous and alarming.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;TakingRick&quot; </attr></ext>

Through its association with Anonymous, 4chan has become associated with [[Project Chanology]], a worldwide protest against the [[Church of Scientology]] held by members of Anonymous. On January 15, 2008, a 4chan user posted to /b/, suggesting participants &quot;do something big&quot; against the Church of Scientology's website. This message resulted in the Church receiving, by its own reports, more than 6,000 threatening phone calls. It quickly grew into a large real-world protest. Unlike previous Anonymous attacks, this action was characterized by 4chan [[meme]]s including [[rickrolling|rickroll]]s and [[Guy Fawkes]] masks. The raid drew criticism from some 4chan users who felt it would bring the site undesirable attention.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;landers&quot; </attr></ext>

On July 27, 2009, AT&amp;T issued a statement claiming that the block was put in place after an AT&amp;T customer was affected by a denial-of-service attack originating from IP addresses connected to img.4chan.org, and was an attempt to &quot;prevent this attack from disrupting service for the impacted AT&amp;T customer, and... our other customers.&quot; AT&amp;T maintains that the block was not related to the content on 4chan.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2350814,00.asp/|title=AT&amp;T Confirms 4chan Block After DoS Attack|date=2009-07-27|publisher=PC Mag|accessdate=2009-07-27|work=Chloe Albanesius}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the end, this wasn't a sinister act of censorship, but rather a bit of a mistake and a poorly executed, disproportionate response on AT&amp;T's part. Whoever pulled the trigger on blackholing the site probably didn't anticipate [nor intend] the consequences of doing so.

We're glad to see this short-lived debacle has prompted renewed interest and debate over net neutrality and Internet censorship—two very important issues that don't get nearly enough attention—so perhaps this was all just a blessing in disguise.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concerning the AT&amp;T claims of DDoS attacks originating from 4chan, moot confirmed it was due to a network error:<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;4chan Status&quot;</attr></ext>
&lt;blockquote&gt;For the past three weeks, 4chan has been under a constant DDoS attack. We were able to filter this specific type of attack in a fashion that was more or less transparent to the end user.

Unfortunately, as an unintended consequence of the method used, some Internet users received errant traffic from one of our network switches. A handful happened to be AT&amp;T customers&lt;/blockquote&gt;
