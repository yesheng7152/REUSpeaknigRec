'''Laika''' (<template><title>lang-ru</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Лайка</value></part></template>, literally meaning &quot;Barker&quot;; c. 1954 – November 3, 1957) was a [[Soviet space dogs|Soviet space dog]] that became the first [[Animals in space|animal]] to [[orbit]] the Earth &amp;ndash; as well as the first animal to die in orbit.

As little was known about the impact of [[spaceflight]] on living creatures at the time of Laika's mission, and the technology to de-orbit had not yet been developed, there was no expectation of Laika's survival. Some scientists believed humans would be unable to survive the launch or the conditions of outer space, so engineers viewed flights by non-human animals as a necessary precursor to human missions.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=RussiaOpensMonument</attr></ext>  Laika, a stray dog, originally named '''Kudryavka''' (<template><title>lang-ru</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Кудрявка</value></part></template> ''Little Curly''), underwent training with two other dogs, and was eventually chosen as the occupant of the Soviet spacecraft [[Sputnik 2]] that was launched into outer space on November 3, 1957.

Laika likely died within hours after launch from [[Hyperthermia|overheating]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;DM&quot; </attr></ext> possibly caused by a failure of the central R-7 sustainer to separate from the payload.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Asif Siddiqi, Sputnik and the Soviet Space Challenge, 2000, p. 174</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The true cause and time of her death was not made public until 2002; instead, it was widely reported that she died when her oxygen ran out on day six,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Beischer1962</attr><inner>{{cite journal |author=Beischer, DE; Fregly, AR |title=Animals and man in space.

The experiment aimed to prove that a living passenger could survive being launched into orbit and endure [[weightlessness]], paving the way for [[human spaceflight]] and providing scientists with some of the first data on how living [[organism]]s react to spaceflight environments.

On April 11, 2008, Russian officials unveiled a monument to Laika. A small monument in her honour was built near the military research facility in Moscow which prepared Laika's flight to space. It features a dog standing on top of a rocket.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=RussiaOpensMonument</attr><inner>&quot;[http://www.bostonherald.com/news/international/europe/view.bg?articleid=1086514 Russia opens monument to Laika, first dog in space]&quot;.

<template lineStart="1"><title>main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Sputnik 2</value></part></template>
After the success of [[Sputnik 1]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]], the Soviet leader, wanted a spacecraft launched on November 7, 1957, the 40th anniversary of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]. A more sophisticated satellite was already under construction, but it would not be ready until December; this satellite would later become [[Sputnik 3]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;NASA3&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web|url=http://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/harford.html|title=Korolev's Triple Play: Sputniks 1, 2, and 3|publisher=NASA|author=James J. Harford|year=1997| accessdate = 2006-09-26}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

To meet the November deadline, a new craft would have to be built. Khrushchev specifically wanted his engineers to deliver a &quot;space spectacular,&quot; a mission that would repeat the triumph of Sputnik I, stunning the world with Soviet prowess. The planners settled on an orbital flight with a dog. Soviet rocket engineers had long intended a canine orbit before attempting human spaceflight; since 1951, they had lofted 12 dogs into sub-orbital space on ballistic flights, working gradually toward an orbital mission possibly some time in 1958. To satisfy Khrushchev's demands, the orbital canine flight was expedited for the November launch.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;AJL&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/Sputnik2/SpaceViews%20November%201997%20Articles.htm|title=Sputnik 2: The First Animal in Orbit|author= Andrew J.

According to Russian sources, the official decision to launch Sputnik 2 was made on October 10 or 12, leaving the team only four weeks to design and build the spacecraft.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;AZ&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/news/laika_anniversary_991103.html|title=The True Story of Laika the Dog|author=Anatoly Zak|date=1999-11-03| accessdate = 2006-09-28}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Sputnik 2, therefore, was something of a rush job, with most elements of the spacecraft being constructed from rough sketches. Aside from the primary mission of sending a living passenger into space, Sputnik 2 also contained instrumentation for measuring [[solar radiation]] and [[cosmic ray]]s.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;NASA3&quot; </attr></ext><comment>&lt;!--http://dogsinthenews.com/issues/0211/articles/021103a.htm--&gt;</comment>

The craft was equipped with a life-support system consisting of an [[oxygen generator]] and devices to avoid [[oxygen toxicity|oxygen poisoning]] and to absorb [[carbon dioxide]]. A fan, designed to activate whenever the cabin temperature exceeded <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>15</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>°C</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>°F</value></part><part><name>abbr</name><equals>=</equals><value>on</value></part></template>, was added to keep the dog cool. Enough food (in a gelatinous form) was provided for a seven-day flight, and the dog was fitted with a bag to collect waste. A [[Dog harness|harness]] was designed to be fitted to the dog, and there were chains to restrict her movements to standing, sitting or lying down; there was no room to turn around in the cabin. An [[electrocardiogram]] monitored heart rate and further instrumentation tracked respiration rate, maximum arterial pressure and the dog's movements.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name = &quot;DM&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;SPUT1&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/Sputnik2/sputnik2more.html|title=Sputnik-2, more news from distant history|author= Sven Grahn| accessdate = 2004-12-01}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Laika, the Russian name for several [[List of dog breeds|breeds of dogs]] similar to the [[husky]], was the name popularized around the world.

To adapt the dogs to the confines of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. [[Laxatives]] did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. The dogs were placed in [[centrifuge]]s that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their [[blood pressure]] to increase by 30–65 [[torr]]. The dogs were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;SPUT1&quot; </attr></ext>

Before the launch, one of the scientists took Laika home to play with his children. In a book chronicling the story of Soviet space medicine, Dr. Vladimir Yazdovsky wrote, &quot;I wanted to do something nice for her: She had so little time left to live.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;APSTAT&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24069819/|title=Space dog monument opens in Russia|publisher=MSNBC|date=2008-04-11| accessdate = 2008-04-15|author=Vladimir Isachenkov}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="2" i="3">==Voyage==</h>

According to a [[NASA]] document, Laika was placed in the satellite on October 31, 1957—three days before the start of the mission.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;SPUT1&quot; </attr></ext> At that time of year the temperatures at the launch site were extremely cold, and a hose connected to a heater was used to keep her container warm. Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch. Just prior to liftoff on November 3, 1957 from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]], Laika's fur was sponged in a weak [[ethanol|alcohol]] solution and carefully groomed, while [[iodine]] was painted onto the areas where sensors would be placed to monitor her bodily functions.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;LM&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.novareinna.com/bridge/laika.html|title=Memorial to Laika| accessdate = 2006-09-26}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

At peak acceleration Laika's respiration increased to between three and four times the pre-launch rate.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;SPUT1&quot; </attr></ext> The sensors showed her heart rate was 103 beats/min before launch and increased to 240 beats/min during the early acceleration. After reaching orbit, Sputnik 2's [[nose cone]] was jettisoned successfully; however the &quot;Block A&quot; core did not separate as planned, preventing the thermal control system from operating correctly. Some of the [[thermal insulation]] tore loose, raising the cabin temperature to <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>40</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>°C</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>°F</value></part><part><name>abbr</name><equals>=</equals><value>on</value></part></template>.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;NASA2&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1957-002A|title=Sputnik 2|publisher=NASA|date=2005-10-20| accessdate = 2006-09-26}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> After three hours of [[weightlessness]], Laika's pulse rate had settled back to 102 beats/min,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;JAP&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/91/4/1501|title=Historical aspects of the early Soviet/Russian manned space program|volume=91|issue=4| pages=1501–1511|author=John B.

The Russian scientists had planned to euthanize Laika with a poisoned serving of food. For many years, the Soviet Union gave conflicting statements that she had died either from [[asphyxia|oxygen starvation]]<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Beischer1962</attr></ext> when the batteries failed, or that she had been euthanized. Many rumors circulated about the exact manner of her passing. In 1999, several Russian sources reported that Laika had died when the cabin overheated on the fourth day.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;AZ&quot; </attr></ext> In October 2002, Dimitri Malashenkov, one of the scientists behind the Sputnik 2 mission, revealed that Laika had died by the fourth circuit of flight from overheating. According to a paper he presented to the World Space Congress in [[Houston, Texas]], &quot;It turned out that it was practically impossible to create a reliable temperature control system in such limited time constraints.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;DM&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite journal|title=Abstract:Some Unknown Pages of the Living Organisms' First Orbital Flight|author=Malashenkov, D.

In the Soviet Union, there was less controversy. Neither the media, books in the following years, nor the public openly questioned the decision to send a dog into space. It was not until 1998, after the collapse of the Soviet regime, that [[Oleg Gazenko]], one of the scientists responsible for sending Laika into space, expressed regret for allowing her to die:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Work with animals is a source of suffering to all of us. We treat them like babies who cannot speak. The more time passes, the more I'm sorry about it. We shouldn't have done it...
