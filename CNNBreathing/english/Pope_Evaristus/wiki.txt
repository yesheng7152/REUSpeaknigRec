'''Pope Evaristus''' (died c. 107) is accounted the fifth Bishop of Rome, holding office from c. 99 to his death c. 107.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope St. Evaristus}}</ref><ref>According to ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', he died in 108.</ref> He was also known as '''Aristus'''.

Little is known about St. Evaristus. According to the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]'', he came from a family of [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenic Jewish origin]] living in [[Bethlehem]]. He was elected during the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Domitian]], the time of the [[Persecution of Christians|second general persecution]], and succeeded [[Pope Clement I|St. Clement]] in the [[Holy See|See of Rome]].

[[Eusebius]], in his ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' IV, I, stated that Evaristus died in the 12th year of the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Trajan]], after holding the office of bishop of the Romans for eight years. He is said by the ''Liber Pontificalis'' to have divided Rome into several "[[Titulus (Roman Catholic)|titles]]," or parishes, assigning a [[priest]] to each, and appointed seven [[deacon]]s for the city.

He is usually accorded the title of martyr; however, there is no confirmation of this in the case of Pope Evaristus, who is listed without that title in the [[Roman Martyrology]], with a feast day on 26 October.<ref>"Martyrologium Romanum" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 ISBN 88-209-7210-7)</ref> It is probable that St. Evaristus was buried near [[St. Peter's tomb]] in the Vatican.<ref>[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=633 Catholic Online – Saints & Angels: "St. Evaristus"]</ref>  It is also probable that [[John the Apostle|St. John]] the apostle died during the beginning of Evaristus' reign.
