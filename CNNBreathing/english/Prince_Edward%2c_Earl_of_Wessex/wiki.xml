Prince Edward Antony Richard Louis was born at [[Buckingham Palace]], on 10 March 1964, the third son and fourth and last child of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].

As with his older siblings, a [[governess]] was appointed to look after the Prince and was responsible for his early education at Buckingham Palace. At the age of seven, Edward was then sent to Gibbs School before attending, in September 1972, [[Heatherdown School]], near [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] in [[Berkshire]]. He then, as his father and elder brothers had done before him, moved to [[Gordonstoun]], in northern [[Scotland]], and was appointed [[Head Boy]] in his last term. Edward obtained a C-grade and two D-grades at [[A-level]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite news|title=The family qualifications|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=16 October 2006|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1531553/The-family-qualifications.html}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> and after his schooling spent a [[gap year]] abroad, working as a house tutor and junior master for two terms in September 1982 at the [[Wanganui Collegiate School]] in New Zealand.

Upon his return to Britain, Edward matriculated at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], to read history. His admission to Cambridge caused some controversy at the time, as his A-level grades were far below the standard normally required, &quot;straight As&quot;, for entry to the university.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite news|title=The prince with a difference| date=11 June 1999|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/06/99/royal_wedding/363894.stm|work=BBC News}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Edward graduated in 1986, with [[British undergraduate degree classification|lower second class honours]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite news|title=William enjoys a degree of success|date=12 June 2005|url=http://news.scotsman.com/news/William-enjoys-a-degree-of.2634447.jp|newspaper=The Scotsman|location=Edinburgh|first=Jeremy|last=Watson}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> and, as is customary at Cambridge, proceeded [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts (Cantab)]] in 1991, making Edward the fourth of only five members of the Royal Family in history to have obtained a university degree.

<h level="2" i="2">==Career==</h>
Prince Edward made two very public attempts to pursue a career but, after failing at both, returned to the life of a full-time member of the royal family.

On leaving university, Prince Edward joined the [[Royal Marines]] to train as an officer cadet; the Marines had given the Prince £12,000 to pay his tuition at Cambridge as a condition of future service.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/12/world/commando-life-losing-appeal-for-prince.html |title=Commando Life Losing Appeal for Prince? |website=New York Times|date=12 January 1987|accessdate=10 January 2014}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> However, in January 1987 he dropped out of the grueling course after completing just one third of the 12-month training. Media reported, at the time, that the move prompted a berating from Prince Philip who &quot;reduced his son to prolonged tears.&quot; The [[Sunday Times]] declared Edward was &quot;a mama's boy who still took his two-foot teddy bear to bed and had no business being in the Marines.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web |url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20095504,00.html|title=Edward Goes His Own Way |date=26 January 1987 |website=people.com |publisher=People |accessdate=10 January 2014}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-348291/Will-Harry-hero--new-Prince-Edward.html |title=Will Harry be a hero - or the new Prince Edward? |website=Daily Mail |accessdate=10 January 2014}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> At a subsequent [[Royal Tournament]], British commandos wore T-shirts that read &quot;You can turn a frog into a Prince, but you can't turn a Prince into a Marine.&quot; (Nonetheless, on his 43rd birthday, Edward was appointed [[colonel]] of the [[Royal Wessex Yeomanry]] and has, since, received eight other military titles, including the colonelcy of Canada's [[Saskatchewan Dragoons]].

After dropping out of the Marines, Edward decided to pursue a career in entertainment. He commissioned the 1986 musical ''[[Cricket (musical)|Cricket]]'' from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]], for his mother's 60th birthday celebration, which led to a job offer at Webber's [[Really Useful Group|Really Useful Theatre Company]], where he worked as a [[production assistant]] on musicals such as ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[Starlight Express]]'', and ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]''.

Edward's first foray into television production was the programme ''[[The Grand Knockout Tournament]]'', informally known as ''It's a Royal Knockout'', on 15 June 1987, in which teams sponsored by himself, [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] and the [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Duke]] and [[Sarah, Duchess of York|Duchess of York]] competed for charity.

Edward has been a [[British prince]] from birth. His present style and title in full is: ''His Royal Highness The Prince Edward Antony Richard Louis, Earl of Wessex, Viscount Severn, Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, [[Aide-de-Camp]] to Her Majesty''. The Earldom of Wessex has a distinguished royal history, the [[Kingdom of Wessex]] having played the leading role in the unification of [[Anglo-Saxon England]]. The last person to hold the earldom was [[Harold Godwinson]], prior to his accession to the English throne in 1066.

For 17 to 23 May 2014 only, Edward became entitled to be called (albeit academically) His Grace The Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

As Edward's 1999 marriage approached, experts suggested the former royal dukedoms of [[Duke of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[Duke of Sussex|Sussex]] as the most likely to be granted to him. Instead, the Palace announced that Prince Edward would eventually succeed to the title [[Duke of Edinburgh]], currently held by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|his father]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheEarlofWessex/Stylesandtitles.aspx Styles and titles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> In the meantime, in keeping with the tradition of a monarch's son receiving a title upon marriage, but preserving the rank of duke for the future, Prince Edward became the first British prince in centuries to be specifically created an earl, rather than a duke. ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' reported that he was drawn to the historic title ''Earl of Wessex'' after watching the 1998 film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', in which a character with that title is played by [[Colin Firth]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;EdwardSundayTelegraph&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-wedding/8196402/Royal-wedding-Prince-William-asks-the-Queen-not-to-make-him-a-duke.html|title=Royal wedding: Prince William asks the Queen not to make him a duke|author=Richard Eden|date=12 December 2010|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=12 December 2010}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>
