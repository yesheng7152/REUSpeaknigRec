==Early life and education==
[[File:G House from the South Lawn on an Autumn Afternoon.jpg|thumb|left|Gordonstoun]]
{{British Royal Family}}
Prince Edward Antony Richard Louis was born at [[Buckingham Palace]], on 10 March 1964, the third son and fourth and last child of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. Baptised on 2 May 1964 in the Private Chapel at [[Windsor Castle]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/windsor_18.htm|title=Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|accessdate=7 January 2009|work=The House Of Windsor|publisher=English Monarchs|quote=He was baptised on 2 May 1964, at the private chapel at Windsor Castle by the Dean of Windsor and was given the names Edward Anthony Richard Louis.}}</ref> by the then [[Dean of Windsor]], [[Robin Woods]]; the Prince's godparents were: [[Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester|Prince Richard of Gloucester]] (his mother's first cousin); the [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]] (his mother's first cousin by marriage, for whom [[Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent]], his mother's aunt by marriage, stood proxy); [[Princess Sophie of Greece and Denmark|Princess George William of Hanover]] (his paternal aunt); the [[Louis, Prince of Hesse and by Rhine|Prince of Hesse and by Rhine]] (his cousin); and the [[Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon|Earl of Snowdon]] (his maternal uncle by marriage).<ref name="Yvonne">[http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings Yvonne's Royalty Home Page – Royal Christenings]</ref> As a child of the Sovereign, Edward was styled from birth as ''His Royal Highness The Prince Edward''.

As with his older siblings, a [[governess]] was appointed to look after the Prince and was responsible for his early education at Buckingham Palace. At the age of seven, Edward was then sent to Gibbs School before attending, in September 1972, [[Heatherdown School]], near [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]] in [[Berkshire]]. He then, as his father and elder brothers had done before him, moved to [[Gordonstoun]], in northern [[Scotland]], and was appointed [[Head Boy]] in his last term. Edward obtained a C-grade and two D-grades at [[A-level]],<ref>{{cite news|title=The family qualifications|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=16 October 2006|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1531553/The-family-qualifications.html}}</ref> and after his schooling spent a [[gap year]] abroad, working as a house tutor and junior master for two terms in September 1982 at the [[Wanganui Collegiate School]] in New Zealand.

Upon his return to Britain, Edward matriculated at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], to read history. His admission to Cambridge caused some controversy at the time, as his A-level grades were far below the standard normally required, "straight As", for entry to the university.<ref>{{cite news|title=The prince with a difference| date=11 June 1999|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/06/99/royal_wedding/363894.stm|work=BBC News}}</ref> Edward graduated in 1986, with [[British undergraduate degree classification|lower second class honours]],<ref>{{cite news|title=William enjoys a degree of success|date=12 June 2005|url=http://news.scotsman.com/news/William-enjoys-a-degree-of.2634447.jp|newspaper=The Scotsman|location=Edinburgh|first=Jeremy|last=Watson}}</ref> and, as is customary at Cambridge, proceeded [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts (Cantab)]] in 1991, making Edward the fourth of only five members of the Royal Family in history to have obtained a university degree.

==Career==
Prince Edward made two very public attempts to pursue a career but, after failing at both, returned to the life of a full-time member of the royal family. 

[[File:Royal Wedding Stockholm 2010-Konserthuset-403.jpg|thumb|left|The Earl and [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex|Countess of Wessex]] at the [[wedding of Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden, and Daniel Westling|wedding of the Crown Princess of Sweden]] in June 2010]]
On leaving university, Prince Edward joined the [[Royal Marines]] to train as an officer cadet; the Marines had given the Prince £12,000 to pay his tuition at Cambridge as a condition of future service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/12/world/commando-life-losing-appeal-for-prince.html |title=Commando Life Losing Appeal for Prince? |website=New York Times|date=12 January 1987|accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref> However, in January 1987 he dropped out of the grueling course after completing just one third of the 12-month training. Media reported, at the time, that the move prompted a berating from Prince Philip who "reduced his son to prolonged tears." The [[Sunday Times]] declared Edward was "a mama's boy who still took his two-foot teddy bear to bed and had no business being in the Marines."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20095504,00.html|title=Edward Goes His Own Way |date=26 January 1987 |website=people.com |publisher=People |accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-348291/Will-Harry-hero--new-Prince-Edward.html |title=Will Harry be a hero - or the new Prince Edward? |website=Daily Mail |accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref> At a subsequent [[Royal Tournament]], British commandos wore T-shirts that read "You can turn a frog into a Prince, but you can't turn a Prince into a Marine." (Nonetheless, on his 43rd birthday, Edward was appointed [[colonel]] of the [[Royal Wessex Yeomanry]] and has, since, received eight other military titles, including the colonelcy of Canada's [[Saskatchewan Dragoons]]. As with other members of the Royal Family, he frequently appears in uniform at public occasions. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/columnists/article-492350/A-uniform-promotion-Edward.html |title=A uniform promotion for Edward |website=Daily Mail|date=7 November 2007 |accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/256487/Meanwhile-yet-another-uniform-for-Edward |title=Meanwhile, yet another uniform for Edward |website=Daily Express|date=3 July 2011 |accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref>)

After dropping out of the Marines, Edward decided to pursue a career in entertainment. He commissioned the 1986 musical ''[[Cricket (musical)|Cricket]]'' from [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]], for his mother's 60th birthday celebration, which led to a job offer at Webber's [[Really Useful Group|Really Useful Theatre Company]], where he worked as a [[production assistant]] on musicals such as ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', ''[[Starlight Express]]'', and ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]''. His duties reportedly involved making tea for the artistic staff.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-01-19/entertainment/ca-37020_1_prince-edward-theater |title=Prince Edward Joins the Theater at 'Lowest Rung' |website=LA Times|date=19 January 1988 |accessdate=10 January 2014}}</ref> While there he met actress [[Ruthie Henshall]], whom he dated for two years.

Edward's first foray into television production was the programme ''[[The Grand Knockout Tournament]]'', informally known as ''It's a Royal Knockout'', on 15 June 1987, in which teams sponsored by himself, [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]] and the [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Duke]] and [[Sarah, Duchess of York|Duchess of York]] competed for charity. The media attacked the programme; it was later reported that the Queen was not in favour of the event and that all her courtiers had advised against it.<ref>Ben Pimlott [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/royals/readings/polish.html "Polishing Their Image"], extract from ''The Queen'', HarperCollins (1996) reprinted on the PBS Frontline webpage</ref> In March 1988, Edward was invited to make a cameo appearance in ''[[Silver Nemesis]]'', the 25th anniversary storyline of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', but declined.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1311247/Ed-terminate-Or-Buckingham-Palace-vetoed-Prince-Edwards-role-Doctor-Who.html |title=Ed-terminate! Or why Buckingham Palace vetoed Prince Edward's role in Doctor Who |website=Daily Mail|date=12 September 2010 |accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref>

In 1993, Edward formed Ardent Productions, under the name of Edward Windsor from 1995,<ref name="Beckett">{{cite news|first=Andy|last=Beckett|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2002/mar/05/themonarchy.broadcasting|title=It's a royal cock-up|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=5 March 2002}}</ref> and later Edward Wessex. Ardent was involved in the production of a number of documentaries and dramas,<ref name="BFI">[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/organisation/158294?view=credit Ardent Productions Filoography], BFI Film & TV Database</ref> but Edward was accused in the media of using his royal connections for financial gain,<ref>{{cite news|first=Susan|last=Karlin|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/sep/26/entertainment/ca-26454|title=Edward Windsor: Truly a Prince Among Producers|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=26 September 1998}}</ref> and the company was referred to by some industry insiders as "a sad joke" due to a perceived lack of professionalism in its operations. ''[[The Guardian]]'' opined that "to watch Ardent's few dozen hours of broadcast output is to enter a strange kingdom where every man in Britain still wears a tie, where pieces to camera are done in cricket jumpers, where people clasp their hands behind their backs like guardsmen. Commercial breaks are filled with army recruiting advertisements." <ref>{{cite news|first=Andy|last=Becket|url=http://www.theguardian.com/media/2002/mar/05/themonarchy.broadcasting|title=It's a royal cock-up|newspaper=The Guardian|date=4 March 2002}}</ref>

Ardent's productions were seemingly more kindly received in the United States<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/436805.stm|title=Edward: No intention to offend|work=BBC News|date=2 September 1999}}</ref> and a documentary Edward made on his great uncle, [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] (later the Duke of Windsor) in 1996,<ref name="BFI"/> sold well around the globe.<ref>{{cite news|first=Ben|last=Summerskill|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2000/oct/29/broadcasting.society|title=Losses double at Prince's TV firm|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London|date=29 October 2000}}</ref> Nonetheless, the company reported losses for every year of its existence except one, and only then because Edward did not draw a salary.<ref name="Beckett"/> An Ardent two-man film crew invaded the privacy of his nephew, [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] in September 2001, while he was studying at the [[University of St Andrews]], against industry guidelines regarding the Royals' privacy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1566416.stm|title=Edward's turbulent media career|work=BBC News|date=27 September 2001}}</ref> [[Charles, Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]] was reportedly angered by the incident.<ref>{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Alderson|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1358014/Prince-Edward-to-apologise-to-Queen-and-agrees-to-stop-making-royal-films.html|title=Prince Edward to apologise to Queen and agrees to stop making royal films|newspaper=The Sunday Telegraph|location=London|date=30 September 2001}}</ref> In March 2002, the Prince announced that he would step down as director of production and joint managing director of Ardent<ref name="Beckett"/> to concentrate on his public duties and to support the Queen during [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|her Golden Jubilee]] year.

==Marriage==

Edward proposed to Sophie with an [[Asprey]] and [[Garrard & Co|Garrard]] engagement ring worth an estimated £105,000: a two-carat oval diamond flanked by two heart-shaped gemstones set in 18-carat white gold.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://royalweddings.helloonline.com/prince-william-and-kate-middleton/galeria/20100922403/kate-middleton/prince-william/rings/1/11/#ancla|title=Crown jewels: The fabulous rings which sealed the love of Europe's royal couples|newspaper=HELLO! magazine|location=UK}}</ref>

The wedding itself took place on 19 June, of the same year, at [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]] at [[Windsor Castle]]. This was a break from the weddings of Edward's older siblings, which were large, formal events at [[Westminster Abbey]] or [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. On his wedding day, the Queen conferred on Prince Edward the titles of [[Earl of Wessex]] and Viscount Severn, again breaking with the tradition that the son of a sovereign is created a [[duke]]. It was also announced that the Earl of Wessex would be created [[Duke of Edinburgh]] when that dukedom, held by Edward's father since 1947, reverts to the Crown<ref name=Buck1/> (which will happen only after "both the death of the current Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales' succession as King"<ref>''[[Whitaker's Almanack]]'' 2010, page 46 'Peers of the Blood Royal'</ref>), and that any children of the Earl and Countess would be styled as the children of an Earl, rather than as ''Prince/ss'' and ''Royal Highness'' (as they would otherwise have been under the Letters Patent issued by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]]).<ref name=fam>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page5590.asp|title=The Royal Family > Members of the Royal Family > HRH The Earl of Wessex > Marriage and Family|publisher=Buckingham Palace|accessdate=26 October 2008}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}</ref>

The couple have two children: [[Lady Louise Windsor]], born 8 November 2003, and [[James, Viscount Severn]], born 17 December 2007. The family resides at [[Bagshot Park]] in Surrey.

==Official duties==

The Earl has taken on many roles from his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, who is reducing some commitments owing to his age. The Earl replaced him as President of the [[Commonwealth Games]] Federation (since 2006 its Vice-Patron) and opened the [[1990 Commonwealth Games]] in New Zealand and the [[1998 Commonwealth Games]] in Malaysia. He has also taken over the Duke's role in the [[Duke of Edinburgh's Award]] scheme, attending Gold Award ceremonies around the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Duke of Edinburgh's Award|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheEarlofWessex/TheDukeofEdinburghsAward.aspx|work=royal.gov.uk|accessdate=29 August 2013}}</ref>

In February and March 2012, The Earl and Countess visited the Caribbean for the Diamond Jubilee. The itinerary consisted of [[Saint Lucia]]; [[Barbados]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]; [[Grenada]]; [[Trinidad and Tobago]]; [[Montserrat]]; [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]]; [[Anguilla]]; [[Antigua and Barbuda]]. Highlights included Independence Day celebrations in Saint Lucia,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedominican.net/2012/02/royals-to-begin-visit.html| title=Royals to begin Caribbean tour bypasses Dominica|date=16 February 2012|newspaper=The Dominican|accessdate=19 February 2012}}</ref> a joint address to both houses of the Barbados parliament,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bajansunonline.com/barbados-royal-visit-to-mark-queens-diamond-jubilee/|first=Sharon|last=Lynch|title=Barbados: Royal Visit To Mark Queen's Diamond Jubilee|date=27 January 2012|newspaper=Bajan Sun Online|accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref> and a visit to sites affected by the recent volcanic eruptions in Montserrat.

The Earl's appointment as [[Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]] in 2014 was announced in November 2013.[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/the-lord-high-commissioner-to-the-general-assembly-of-the-church-of-scotland-2014]

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==

===Titles and styles===
* '''10 March 1964 – 19 June 1999''': ''His Royal Highness'' The Prince Edward
* '''19 June 1999 - present''': ''His Royal Highness'' The Earl of Wessex
**''in Scotland: '''''17 - 23 May 2014''': ''His Grace'' The Lord High Commissioner

Edward has been a [[British prince]] from birth. His present style and title in full is: ''His Royal Highness The Prince Edward Antony Richard Louis, Earl of Wessex, Viscount Severn, Royal Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, [[Aide-de-Camp]] to Her Majesty''. The Earldom of Wessex has a distinguished royal history, the [[Kingdom of Wessex]] having played the leading role in the unification of [[Anglo-Saxon England]]. The last person to hold the earldom was [[Harold Godwinson]], prior to his accession to the English throne in 1066.

For 17 to 23 May 2014 only, Edward became entitled to be called (albeit academically) His Grace The Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

As Edward's 1999 marriage approached, experts suggested the former royal dukedoms of [[Duke of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[Duke of Sussex|Sussex]] as the most likely to be granted to him. Instead, the Palace announced that Prince Edward would eventually succeed to the title [[Duke of Edinburgh]], currently held by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|his father]].<ref>[http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheEarlofWessex/Stylesandtitles.aspx Styles and titles<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In the meantime, in keeping with the tradition of a monarch's son receiving a title upon marriage, but preserving the rank of duke for the future, Prince Edward became the first British prince in centuries to be specifically created an earl, rather than a duke. ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' reported that he was drawn to the historic title ''Earl of Wessex'' after watching the 1998 film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'', in which a character with that title is played by [[Colin Firth]].<ref name="EdwardSundayTelegraph">{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/royal-wedding/8196402/Royal-wedding-Prince-William-asks-the-Queen-not-to-make-him-a-duke.html|title=Royal wedding: Prince William asks the Queen not to make him a duke|author=Richard Eden|date=12 December 2010|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=12 December 2010}}</ref>
