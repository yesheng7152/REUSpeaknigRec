'''Archimedes of Syracuse''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: <template><title>polytonic</title><part><name index="1"/><value>[[wikt:Ἀρχιμήδης|Ἀρχιμήδης]]</value></part></template>) (''c.'' 287&amp;nbsp;BC &amp;ndash; ''c.'' 212&amp;nbsp;BC) was a [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]], [[physicist]], [[engineer]], [[inventor]], and [[astronomer]]. Although few details of his life are known, he is regarded as one of the leading [[scientist]]s in [[classical antiquity]]. Among his advances in [[physics]] are the foundations of [[Fluid statics|hydrostatics]], [[statics]] and the explanation of the principle of the [[lever]]. He is credited with designing innovative [[machine]]s, including siege engines and the [[Archimedes' screw|screw pump]] that bears his name. Modern experiments have tested claims that Archimedes designed machines capable of lifting attacking ships out of the water and setting ships on fire using an array of mirrors.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name = &quot;death ray&quot;</attr></ext>

Archimedes died during the [[Siege of Syracuse (214&amp;ndash;212 BC)|Siege of Syracuse]] when he was killed by a [[Roman Republic|Roman]] soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed.

Archimedes had proven that the sphere has two thirds of the volume and surface area of the cylinder (including the bases of the latter), and regarded this as the greatest of his mathematical achievements.

Unlike his inventions, the mathematical writings of Archimedes were little known in antiquity. Mathematicians from [[Alexandria]] read and quoted him, but the first comprehensive compilation was not made until ''c.'' 530&amp;nbsp;AD by [[Isidore of Miletus]], while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by [[Eutocius of Ascalon|Eutocius]] in the sixth century AD opened them to wider readership for the first time.

Archimedes was born ''c''. 287&amp;nbsp;BC in the seaport city of [[Syracuse, Sicily]], at that time a colony of [[Magna Graecia]]. The date of birth is based on a statement by the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] historian [[John Tzetzes]] that Archimedes lived for 75 years.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[[T. L.

Archimedes died ''c''. 212&amp;nbsp;BC during the [[Second Punic War]], when Roman forces under General [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] captured the city of Syracuse after a two-year-long [[siege]]. According to the popular account given by [[Plutarch]], Archimedes was contemplating a [[mathematical diagram]] when the city was captured. A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet General Marcellus but he declined, saying that he had to finish working on the problem. The soldier was enraged by this, and killed Archimedes with his sword. Plutarch also gives a <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>lesser-known</value></part></template> account of the death of Archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier. According to this story, Archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments, and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items. General Marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of Archimedes, as he considered him a valuable scientific asset and had ordered that he not be harmed.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;death&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres | url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Death/Histories.html | title = Death of Archimedes: Sources | publisher = [[Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences]] | accessdate = 2007-01-02 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

[[Image:Archimedes sphere and cylinder.svg|thumb|right|A sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder. A sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.]]

The last words attributed to Archimedes are &quot;Do not disturb my circles&quot; (<template><title>lang-el</title><part><name index="1"/><value>μή μου τούς κύκλους τάραττε</value></part></template>), a reference to the circles in the mathematical drawing that he was supposedly studying when disturbed by the Roman soldier.

The tomb of Archimedes carried a sculpture illustrating his favorite mathematical proof, consisting of a [[sphere]] and a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same height and diameter. Archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases. In 75&amp;nbsp;BC, 137 years after his death, the Roman [[orator]] [[Cicero]] was serving as [[quaestor]] in [[Sicily]]. He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes, but none of the locals was able to give him the location. Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse, in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes. Cicero had the tomb cleaned up, and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres | url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Tomb/Cicero.html | title = Tomb of Archimedes: Sources | publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences | accessdate = 2007-01-02 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

The standard versions of the life of Archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of Ancient Rome. The account of the siege of Syracuse given by [[Polybius]] in his ''Universal History'' was written around seventy years after Archimedes' death, and was used subsequently as a source by Plutarch and [[Livy]]. It sheds little light on Archimedes as a person, and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web |name | siege| first=Chris |last=Rorres | url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Siege/Polybius.html | title = Siege of Syracuse| publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences | accessdate = 2007-07-23 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="3" i="3">===The Golden Crown===</h>
[[Image:Archimedes water balance.gif|thumb|right|180px|Archimedes may have used his principle of buoyancy to determine whether the golden crown was less dense than solid gold.]]

The most widely known [[anecdote]] about Archimedes tells of how he invented a method for determining the volume of an object with an irregular shape. According to [[Vitruvius]], a new crown in the shape of a [[laurel wreath]] had been made for [[Hiero II of Syracuse|King Hiero II]], and Archimedes was asked to determine whether it was of solid [[gold]], or whether [[silver]] had been added by a dishonest goldsmith.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | title = ''De Architectura'', Book IX, paragraphs 9–12, text in English and Latin|author= [[Vitruvius]]| publisher = [[University of Chicago]] | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/9*.html|accessdate=2007-08-30}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown, so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its [[density]].
While taking a bath, he noticed that the level of the water in the tub rose as he got in, and realized that this effect could be used to determine the [[volume]] of the crown. For practical purposes water is incompressible,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | title = Incompressibility of Water|author= | publisher =[[Harvard University]] | url = http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scdiroff/lds/NewtonianMechanics/IncompressibilityofWater/IncompressibilityofWater.html|accessdate=2008-02-27}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume. By dividing the weight of the crown by the volume of water displaced, the density of the crown could be obtained. This density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added. Archimedes then took to the streets naked, so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress, crying &quot;[[Eureka (word)|Eureka]]!&quot; ([[Greek language|Greek]]: &quot;εὕρηκα!,&quot; meaning &quot;I have found it!&quot;)<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | title = Buoyancy|author= [[HyperPhysics]]| publisher =[[Georgia State University]] | url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/Hbase/pbuoy.html|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

The story of the golden crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes. Moreover, the practicality of the method it describes has been called into question, due to the prohibitive amount of accuracy required in measuring the water displacement.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;inaccuracy&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres | url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/CrownIntro.html | title = The Golden Crown | publisher = [[Drexel University]] | accessdate = 2009-03-24 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known in [[fluid statics|hydrostatics]] as [[Buoyancy|Archimedes' Principle]], which he describes in his treatise ''On Floating Bodies''. This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | title = ''Archimedes' Principle''|first=Bradley W |last=Carroll |publisher=[[Weber State University]] | url =http://www.physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/principle.htm|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Using this principle, it would have been possible to compare the density of the golden crown to that of solid gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a gold reference sample, then immersing the apparatus in water. If the crown was less dense than gold, it would displace more water due to its larger volume, and thus experience a greater buoyant force than the reference sample. This difference in buoyancy would cause the scale to tip accordingly. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] considered it &quot;probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed, since, besides being very accurate, it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;galileo&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres | url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Crown/bilancetta.html | title = The Golden Crown: Galileo's Balance | publisher = [[Drexel University]] | accessdate = 2009-03-24 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="3" i="4">===The Archimedes Screw===</h>
[[Image:Archimedes-screw one-screw-threads with-ball 3D-view animated small.gif|thumb|left|The [[Archimedes screw]] can raise water efficiently.]]
A large part of Archimedes' work in engineering arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse. The Greek writer [[Athenaeus|Athenaeus of Naucratis]] described how King Hieron II commissioned Archimedes to design a huge ship, the ''[[Syracusia]]'', which could be used for luxury travel, carrying supplies, and as a naval warship. The ''Syracusia'' is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book |last=Casson|first= Lionel|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=''Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World'' |year=1971 |publisher= Princeton University Press |location= |isbn=0691035369 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> According to Athenaeus, it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations, a [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]] and a temple dedicated to the goddess [[Aphrodite]] among its facilities. Since a ship of this size would leak a considerable amount of water through the hull, the [[Archimedes screw]] was purportedly developed in order to remove the bilge water. Archimedes' machine was a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder. It was turned by hand, and could also be used to transfer water from a <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>low-lying</value></part></template> body of water into irrigation canals. The Archimedes screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain.

The [[Claw of Archimedes]] is a weapon that he is said to have designed in order to defend the city of Syracuse. Also known as &quot;the ship shaker,&quot; the claw consisted of a crane-like arm from which a large metal grappling hook was suspended. When the claw was dropped onto an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards, lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it. There have been modern experiments to test the feasibility of the claw, and in 2005 a television documentary entitled ''Superweapons of the Ancient World'' built a version of the claw and concluded that it was a workable device.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres | title = Archimedes' Claw - Illustrations and Animations - a range of possible designs for the claw| publisher = Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences | url = http://www.math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Claw/illustrations.html|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | title = Archimedes' Claw - watch an animation|first=Bradley W |last=Carroll | publisher = Weber State University| url = http://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/claw.htm|accessdate=2007-08-12}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

[[Image:Archimedes Heat Ray conceptual diagram.svg|thumb|right|Archimedes may have used mirrors acting collectively as a [[parabolic reflector]] to burn ships attacking [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].]]

The 2nd century AD historian [[Lucian]] wrote that during the [[Siege of Syracuse (212 BC)|Siege of Syracuse]] (''c.'' 214&amp;ndash;212&amp;nbsp;BC), Archimedes repelled an attack by Roman soldiers with a [[burning-glass]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>''Hippias'', C.2.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The device was used to focus sunlight onto approaching ships, causing them to catch fire. This purported weapon, sometimes called the &quot;Archimedes heat ray,&quot; has been the subject of ongoing debate about its credibility since the Renaissance.

This would have used the principle of the [[parabolic reflector]] in a manner similar to a [[solar furnace]].

A test of the Archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Ioannis Sakkas. The experiment took place at the [[Skaramagas]] naval base outside [[Athens]]. On this occasion 70 mirrors were used, each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet (1.5 by 1&amp;nbsp;m). The mirrors were pointed at a plywood <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>mock-up</value></part></template> of a Roman warship at a distance of around 160&amp;nbsp;feet (50&amp;nbsp;m). When the mirrors were focused accurately, the ship burst into flames within a few seconds. The plywood ship had a coating of [[bitumen|tar]] paint, which may have aided combustion.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | title = Archimedes' Weapon| publisher = [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]|date = November 26, 1973| url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908175,00.html?promoid=googlep|accessdate=2007-08-12}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

In October 2005 a group of students from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] carried out an experiment with 127 one-foot (30&amp;nbsp;cm) square mirror tiles, focused on a <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>mock-up</value></part></template> wooden ship at a range of around 100&amp;nbsp;feet (30&amp;nbsp;m). Flames broke out on a patch of the ship, but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes. It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions. The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show ''[[MythBusters]]'', using a wooden fishing boat in [[San Francisco]] as the target. Again some charring occurred, along with a small amount of flame. In order to catch fire, wood needs to reach its [[flash point]], which is around 300 degrees Celsius (570&amp;nbsp;°F).<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | title = How Wildfires Work|author= Bonsor, Kevin| publisher = [[HowStuffWorks]]| url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/wildfire.htm|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

When ''MythBusters'' broadcast the result of the San Francisco experiment in January 2006, the claim was placed in the category of &quot;busted&quot; (or failed) because of the length of time and the ideal weather conditions required for combustion to occur. It was also pointed out that since Syracuse faces the sea towards the east, the Roman fleet would have had to attack during the morning for optimal gathering of light by the mirrors. ''MythBusters'' also pointed out that conventional weaponry, such as flaming arrows or bolts from a catapult, would have been a far easier way of setting a ship on fire at short distances.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;death ray&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web | title = Archimedes Death Ray: Testing with MythBusters|author= | publisher = MIT| url = http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www//experiments/deathray/10_Mythbusters.html|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

[[Cicero]] (106&amp;ndash;43&amp;nbsp;BC) mentions Archimedes briefly in his [[dialogue]] ''[[De re publica]]'', which portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129&amp;nbsp;BC. After the capture of Syracuse ''c.'' 212&amp;nbsp;BC, General [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] is said to have taken back to Rome two mechanisms used as aids in astronomy, which showed the motion of the Sun, Moon and five planets. Cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]] and [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]]. The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse, and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome. Marcellus' mechanism was demonstrated, according to Cicero, by [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus]] to [[Lucius Furius Philus]], who described it thus:

[[Image:Archimedes pi.svg|thumb|right|Archimedes used the [[method of exhaustion]] to approximate the value of [[pi|π]].]]

Archimedes was able to use [[infinitesimal]]s in a way that is similar to modern [[Integral|integral calculus]]. Through proof by contradiction ([[reductio ad absurdum]]), he could give answers to problems to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while specifying the limits within which the answer lay. This technique is known as the [[method of exhaustion]], and he employed it to approximate the value of [[pi|π]] (pi). He did this by drawing a larger [[polygon]] outside a [[circle]] and a smaller polygon inside the circle. As the number of sides of the polygon increases, it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle. When the polygons had 96 sides each, he calculated the lengths of their sides and showed that the value of π lay between <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>3 + 1/7</value></part></template> (approximately 3.1429) and <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>3 + 10/71</value></part></template> (approximately 3.1408), consistent with its actual value of approximately 3.1416. He also proved that the [[area]] of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the [[square (geometry)|square]] of the [[radius]] of the circle.

In ''[[Measurement of a Circle]]'', Archimedes gives the value of the [[square root]] of 3 as being more than <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>265/153</value></part></template> (approximately 1.7320261) and less than <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>1351/780</value></part></template> (approximately 1.7320512). The actual value is approximately 1.7320508, making this a very accurate estimate. He introduced this result without offering any explanation of the method used to obtain it. This aspect of the work of Archimedes caused [[John Wallis]] to remark that he was: &quot;as it were of set purpose to have covered up the traces of his investigation as if he had grudged posterity the secret of his method of inquiry while he wished to extort from them assent to his results.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Quoted in T.

[[Image:Parabolic segment and inscribed triangle.svg|thumb|right|As proven by Archimedes, the area of the parabolic segment in the upper figure is equal to 4/3 that of the inscribed triangle in the lower figure.]]
In ''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]'', Archimedes proved that the area enclosed by a [[parabola]] and a straight line is 4/3 times the area of a corresponding inscribed [[triangle]] as shown in the figure at right. He expressed the solution to the problem as an [[Series (mathematics)#Infinite series|infinite]] [[geometric series]] with the [[Geometric series#Common ratio|common ratio]] <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>1/4</value></part></template>:

If the first term in this series is the area of the triangle, then the second is the sum of the areas of two triangles whose bases are the two smaller [[secant line]]s, and so on. This proof uses a variation of the series <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>[[1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + · · ·]]</value></part></template> which sums to <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>1/3</value></part></template>.

In ''[[The Sand Reckoner]]'', Archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain. In doing so, he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted. He wrote: &quot;There are some, King Gelo (Gelo II, son of [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]]), who think that the number of the sand is infinite in multitude; and I mean by the sand not only that which exists about Syracuse and the rest of Sicily but also that which is found in every region whether inhabited or uninhabited.&quot; To solve the problem, Archimedes devised a system of counting based on the [[myriad]]. The word is from the Greek <template><title>polytonic</title><part><name index="1"/><value>μυριάς</value></part></template> ''murias'', for the number 10,000. He proposed a number system using powers of a myriad of myriads (100 million) and concluded that the number of grains of sand required to fill the universe would be 8 [[Names of large numbers|vigintillion]], or 8<template><title>e</title><part><name index="1"/><value>63</value></part></template>.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | title = The Sand Reckoner |first=Bradley W |last=Carroll | publisher = Weber State University| url = http://physics.weber.edu/carroll/Archimedes/sand.htm|accessdate=2007-07-23}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="2" i="9">==Writings==</h>
The written work of Archimedes has not survived as well as that of [[Euclid]], and seven of his treatises are known to have existed only through references made to them by other authors. [[Pappus of Alexandria]] mentions ''[[On Sphere-Making]]'' and another work on [[polyhedron|polyhedra]], while [[Theon of Alexandria]] quotes a remark about [[refraction]] from the <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>now-lost</value></part></template> ''Catoptrica''.<template><title>Ref_label</title><part><name index="1"/><value>B</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>b</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>none</value></part></template> During his lifetime, Archimedes made his work known through correspondence with the mathematicians in [[Alexandria]]. The writings of Archimedes were collected by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] architect [[Isidore of Miletus]] (''c''. 530&amp;nbsp;AD), while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by [[Eutocius of Ascalon|Eutocius]] in the sixth century AD helped to bring his work a wider audience. Archimedes' work was translated into Arabic by [[Thābit ibn Qurra]] (836&amp;ndash;901&amp;nbsp;AD), and Latin by [[Gerard of Cremona]] (''c.'' 1114&amp;ndash;1187&amp;nbsp;AD).

[[Image:Archimedes lever (Small).jpg|thumb|right|Archimedes is said to have remarked about the lever: &quot;Give me a place to stand on, and I will move the Earth.&quot;]]
*''On the Equilibrium of Planes'' (two volumes)
:The first book is in fifteen propositions with seven [[Axiom|postulates]], while the second book is in ten propositions. In this work Archimedes explains the ''[[Torque|Law of the Lever]]'', stating:
<template lineStart="1"><title>cquote</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Magnitudes are in equilibrium at distances reciprocally proportional to their weights.</value></part></template>

*''[[Measurement of a Circle|On the Measurement of a Circle]]''
:This is a short work consisting of three propositions. It is written in the form of a correspondence with [[Dositheus of Pelusium]], who was a student of [[Conon of Samos]]. In Proposition II, Archimedes shows that the value of [[pi|&amp;pi;]] (pi) is greater than <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>223/71</value></part></template> and less than <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>22/7</value></part></template>. The latter figure was used as an approximation of π throughout the Middle Ages and is still used today when only a rough figure is required.
*''[[On Spirals]]''
:This work of 28 propositions is also addressed to Dositheus. The treatise defines what is now called the [[Archimedean spiral]]. It is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points corresponding to the locations over time of a point moving away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line which rotates with constant [[angular velocity]]. Equivalently, in [[Coordinates (mathematics)|polar coordinates]] (''r'', &amp;theta;) it can be described by the equation
::<ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner>\, r=a+b\theta</inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext>
:with [[real number]]s ''a'' and ''b''. This is an early example of a [[Curve|mechanical curve]] (a curve traced by a moving [[point (geometry)|point]]) considered by a Greek mathematician.
*''On the Sphere and the Cylinder'' (two volumes)
:In this treatise addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes obtains the result of which he was most proud, namely the relationship between a [[sphere]] and a [[circumscribe]]d [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] of the same height and [[diameter]]. The volume is '''<ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner>\tfrac{4}{3}\pi r^3</inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext>''' for the sphere, and '''<ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner>2\pi r^3</inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext>''' for the cylinder.

The sphere has a volume and surface area <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>two-thirds</value></part></template> that of the cylinder. A sculpted sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.
*''On Conoids and Spheroids''
:This is a work in 32 propositions addressed to Dositheus. In this treatise Archimedes calculates the areas and volumes of [[cross section (geometry)|sections]] of [[Cone (geometry)|cones]], spheres, and paraboloids.
*''On Floating Bodies'' (two volumes)
:In the first part of this treatise, Archimedes spells out the law of [[wikt:equilibrium|equilibrium]] of fluids, and proves that water will adopt a spherical form around a center of gravity. This may have been an attempt at explaining the theory of contemporary Greek astronomers such as [[Eratosthenes]] that the Earth is round. The fluids described by Archimedes are not <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>self-gravitating</value></part></template>, since he assumes the existence of a point towards which all things fall in order to derive the spherical shape.

[[Image:Archimedes greece 1983.png|thumb|right|Archimedes is commemorated on a Greek postage stamp from 1983.]]

:In the second part, he calculates the equilibrium positions of sections of paraboloids. This was probably an idealization of the shapes of ships' hulls. Some of his sections float with the base under water and the summit above water, similar to the way that icebergs float. Archimedes' principle of buoyancy is given in the work, stated as follows: <template><title>cquote</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Any body wholly or partially immersed in a fluid experiences an upthrust equal to, but opposite in sense to, the weight of the fluid displaced.</value></part></template>
*''[[The Quadrature of the Parabola]]''
:In this work of 24 propositions addressed to Dositheus, Archimedes proves by two methods that the area enclosed by a [[parabola]] and a straight line is 4/3 multiplied by the area of a [[triangle]] with equal base and height. He achieves this by calculating the value of a [[geometric series]] that sums to infinity with the [[ratio]] <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>1/4</value></part></template>.
*''[[Ostomachion|(O)stomachion]]''
:This is a [[dissection puzzle]] similar to a [[Tangram]], and the treatise describing it was found in more complete form in the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]. Archimedes calculates the areas of the 14 pieces which can be assembled to form a [[square (geometry)|square]]. Research published by Dr. Reviel Netz of [[Stanford University]] in 2003 argued that Archimedes was attempting to determine how many ways the pieces could be assembled into the shape of a square.

Archimedes has appeared on postage stamps issued by [[East Germany]] (1973), [[Greece]] (1983), [[Italy]] (1983), [[Nicaragua]] (1971), [[San Marino]] (1982), and [[Spain]] (1963).<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web |first=Chris |last=Rorres |url=http://math.nyu.edu/~crorres/Archimedes/Stamps/stamps.html |title=Stamps of Archimedes |publisher=Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences |accessdate=2007-08-25}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

The exclamation of [[Eureka (word)|Eureka!]] attributed to Archimedes is the state motto of [[California]]. In this instance the word refers to the discovery of gold near [[Sutter's Mill]] in 1848 which sparked the [[California Gold Rush]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web |title=California Symbols |author= |publisher=California State Capitol Museum |url=http://www.capitolmuseum.ca.gov/VirtualTour.aspx?content1=1278&amp;Content2=1374&amp;Content3=1294 |accessdate=2007-09-14}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>
