'''Climate change''' is a change in the statistical distribution of [[weather]] over [[duration|periods of time]] that range from decades to millions of years. It can be a change in the average weather or a change in the distribution of weather events around an average (for example, greater or fewer extreme weather events). Climate change may be limited to a specific [[region]], or may occur across the whole [[Earth]].  It can be caused by recurring, often cyclical [[climate pattern]]s such as [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]], or come in the form of more singular events such as the [[Dust Bowl]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oar.noaa.gov/climate/t_observing.html|title=	
Observing Climate Variability and Change|publisher=[[NOAA]] Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research}}</ref>

In recent usage, especially in the context of [[environmental policy]], climate change usually refers to changes in modern [[climate]]. It may be qualified as [[anthropogenic]] climate change, more generally known as "[[global warming]]" or "[[anthropogenic]] global warming" ([[Global warming|AGW]]).

For information on temperature measurements over various periods, and the data sources available, see [[temperature record]]. For attribution of climate change over the past century, see [[attribution of recent climate change]].

== Causes ==
Factors that can shape climate are [[climate forcing]]s. These include such processes as variations in [[solar radiation]], deviations in the Earth's [[orbit]], [[orogenesis|mountain-building]] and [[continental drift]], and changes in [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations. There are a variety of [[Global warming#Feedback|climate change feedbacks]] that can either amplify or diminish the initial forcing. Some parts of the climate system, such as the oceans and ice caps, respond slowly in reaction to climate forcing because of their large mass. Therefore, the climate system can take centuries or longer to fully respond to new external forcings.

=== Plate tectonics ===

Over the course of millions of years, the motion of tectonic plates reconfigures global land and ocean areas and generates topography. This can affect both global and local patterns of climate and atmosphere-ocean circulation.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1130/0016-7606(1999)111<0497:PIAPAB>2.3.CO;2}}</ref>

The position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and therefore influences patterns of ocean circulation. The locations of the seas are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the globe, and therefore, in determining global climate. A recent example of tectonic control on ocean circulation is the formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] about 5 million years ago, which shut off direct mixing between the [[Atlantic]] and [[Pacific]] Oceans. This strongly affected the [[western boundary current|ocean dynamics]] of what is now the [[Gulf Stream]] and may have led to Northern Hemisphere ice cover.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=16401 | title=Panama: Isthmus that Changed the World | accessdate=2008-07-01 | publisher=[[NASA]] Earth Observatory }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=2508|title=How the Isthmus of Panama Put Ice in the Arctic|last=Gerald H.|first=Haug|date=2004-03-22|publisher=WHOI: Oceanus|accessdate=2009-07-21}}</ref> Earlier, during the [[Carboniferous]] period, plate tectonics may have triggered the large-scale storage of carbon and increased glaciation.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Isotope stratigraphy of the European Carboniferous: proxy signals for ocean chemistry, climate and tectonics| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6V5Y-3XNK494-8&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=7db7616e9dc94e6ed49a817195926851|journal=Chemical Geology|date=1999-09-30|volume=161|issue=1-3|doi=10.1016/S0009-2541(99)00084-4|page=127|author1=Peter Bruckschen|author2=Susanne Oesmanna|author3=Ján Veizer|author-separator=,}}</ref> Geologic evidence points to a "megamonsoonal" circulation pattern during the time of the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]], and climate modeling suggests that the existence of the supercontinent was conducive to the establishment of monsoons.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Judith T.

More locally, topography can influence climate. The existence of mountains (as a product of plate tectonics through [[orogenesis|mountain-building]]) can cause [[orographic precipitation]]. Humidity generally decreases and diurnal temperature swings generally increase with increasing elevation. Mean temperature and the length of the growing season also decrease with increasing elevation. This, along with orographic precipitation, is important for the existence of low-latitude [[alpine glacier]]s and the varied flora and fauna along at different elevations in montane [[ecosystem]]s.

The size of continents is also important. Because of the stabilizing effect of the oceans on temperature, yearly temperature variations are generally lower in coastal areas than they are inland. A larger supercontinent will therefore have more area in which climate is strongly seasonal than will several smaller continents and/or [[island arc]]s.

=== Solar output ===
{{main|Solar variation}}
[[File:Solar Activity Proxies.png|thumb|Variations in solar activity during the last several centuries based on observations of [[sunspot]]s and [[beryllium]] isotopes.]]

The [[sun]] is the predominant source for [[energy]] input to the Earth. Both long- and short-term variations in solar intensity are known to affect global climate.

Early in [[History of Earth|Earth's history]] the sun emitted only 70% as much power as it does today. With the same atmospheric composition as exists today, liquid water should not have existed on Earth. However, there is evidence for the presence of water on the early Earth, in the [[Hadean]]<ref name="Marty, B. 2006 421">{{cite journal|doi=10.2138/rmg.2006.62.18|title=Water in the Early Earth|year=2006|author=Marty, B.|journal=Reviews in Mineralogy and Geochemistry|volume=62|pages=421}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.1110873|year=2005|month=May|title=Zircon thermometer reveals minimum melting conditions on earliest Earth.|volume=308|issue=5723|pages=841–4|issn=0036-8075|pmid=15879213|journal=Science (New York, N.Y.)|author1=Watson, Eb|author2=Harrison, Tm}}</ref> and [[Archean]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1994)022<1067:SWIISL>2.3.CO;2|title=Surface-water influx in shallow-level Archean lode-gold deposits in Western, Australia|year=1994|author=Hagemann, Steffen G.|journal=Geology|volume=22|pages=1067|last2=Gebre-Mariam|first2=Musie|last3=Groves|first3=David I.}}</ref><ref name="Marty, B. 2006 421"/> eons, leading to what is known as the [[faint young sun paradox]].<ref name="Sagan1972">{{cite book | last = Sagan | first = C. | coauthors = G.

In the near-surface [[troposphere]], there is only a small change in temperature (on the order of a tenth of a degree, and only statistically significant in limited areas underneath the peaks in stratospheric zonal wind speed) due to the 11-year solar cycle. Solar intensity variations are considered to have been influential in triggering the [[Little Ice Age]],<ref>[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=4778&page=R1 Solar Influences on Global Change, National Research Council, National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., p. 36, 1994.]</ref> and for some of the warming observed from 1900 to 1950. The cyclical nature of the sun's energy output is not yet fully understood; it differs from the very slow change that is happening within the sun as it ages and evolves, with some studies pointing toward solar radiation increases from cyclical sunspot activity affecting [[global warming]].<ref name="Goddard Space Flight Center">{{cite article| title = NASA Study Finds Increasing Solar Trend That Can Change Climate | year = 2003| url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2003/0313irradiance.html}}</ref>

=== Orbital variations ===
{{main|Milankovitch cycles}}

Slight variations in Earth's [[orbit]] lead to changes in the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface and how it is distributed across the globe. There is very little change to the area-averaged annually-averaged sunshine; but there can be strong changes in the geographical and seasonal distribution. The three types of orbital variations are variations in Earth's [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], changes in [[axial tilt|the tilt angle of Earth's axis of rotation]], and [[precession]] of Earth's axis. Combined together, these produce [[Milankovitch cycles]] which have a large impact on climate and are notable for their correlation to [[glacial period|glacial]] and [[interglacial period]]s,<ref name="msu milankovitch">{{cite web|url=http://www.homepage.montana.edu/~geol445/hyperglac/time1/milankov.htm|title= Milankovitch Cycles and Glaciation|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher= University of Montana}}</ref> their correlation with the advance and retreat of the [[Sahara]],<ref name="msu milankovitch" /> and for their [[cyclostratigraphy|appearance]] in the [[geologic record|stratigraphic record]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3121.1989.tb00403.x|title=A Milankovitch scale for Cenomanian time|year=1989|author=Gale, Andrew S.|journal=Terra Nova|volume=1|pages=420}}</ref>

=== Volcanism ===
[[Volcanism]] is a process of conveying material from the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] of the Earth to its surface. Volcanic eruptions, [[geysers]], and [[hot springs]], are examples of volcanic processes which release gases and/or [[particulates]] into the atmosphere.

[[Volcano|Eruption]]s large enough to affect climate occur on average several times per century, and cause cooling (by partially blocking the transmission of [[solar radiation]] to the Earth's surface) for a period of a few years. The eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991, the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/1997/fs113-97/|title=The Cataclysmic 1991 Eruption of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines |last=Diggles|first=Michael|date=28 February 2005|work=U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 113-97|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|accessdate=2009-10-08}}</ref> (after the 1912 eruption of [[Novarupta]]<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1130/B25768.1|title=The transition from explosive to effusive eruptive regime: The example of the 1912 Novarupta eruption, Alaska|year=2006|last1=Adams|first1=Nancy K.|last2=Houghton|first2=Bruce F.|last3=Fagents|first3=Sarah A.|last4=Hildreth|first4=Wes|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|volume=118|pages=620}}</ref>) affected the climate substantially. Global temperatures decreased by about 0.5 °C (0.9 °F). The eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in 1815 caused the [[Year Without a Summer]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1191/0309133303pp379ra|title=Climatic, environmental and human consequences of the largest known historic eruption: Tambora volcano (Indonesia) 1815|year=2003|last1=Oppenheimer|first1=Clive|journal=Progress in Physical Geography|volume=27|pages=230}}</ref> Much larger eruptions, known as [[large igneous province]]s, occur only a few times every hundred million years, but may cause global warming and [[mass extinction]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(00)00037-4|title=Large igneous provinces and mass extinctions|year=2001|last1=Wignall|first1=P|journal=Earth-Science Reviews|volume=53|pages=1}}</ref>

Volcanoes are also part of the extended [[carbon cycle]]. Over very long (geological) time periods, they release carbon dioxide from the Earth's crust and mantle, counteracting the uptake by sedimentary rocks and other geological [[carbon dioxide sink]]s. According to the [[US Geological Survey]], however, estimates are that human activities generate more than 130 times the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanoes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Hazards/What/VolGas/volgas.html|title= Volcanic Gases and Their Effects|accessdate=2008-01-21|date=2006-01-10|publisher= U.S. Department of the Interior}}</ref>

=== Ocean variability ===
{{main|Thermohaline circulation}}
[[File:Ocean circulation conveyor belt.jpg|thumb|A schematic of modern [[thermohaline]] circulation]]

The ocean is a fundamental part of the climate system. Short-term fluctuations (years to a few decades) such as the [[ENSO|El Niño–Southern Oscillation]], the [[Pacific decadal oscillation]], the [[North Atlantic oscillation]], and the [[Arctic oscillation]], represent climate variability rather than climate change. On longer time scales, alterations to ocean processes such as [[thermohaline circulation]] play a key role in redistributing heat by carrying out a very slow and extremely deep movement of [[water]], and the long-term redistribution of [[heat]] in the world's oceans.

=== Human influences ===
{{main|Global warming}}

Anthropogenic factors are human activities that change the environment. In some cases the chain of causality of human influence on the climate is direct and unambiguous (for example, the effects of irrigation on local humidity), while in other instances it is less clear. Various hypotheses for human-induced climate change have been argued for many years. Presently the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus on climate change]] is that human activity is very likely the cause for the rapid increase in global average temperatures over the past several decades.<ref name="IPCC1">IPCC. (2007) Climate change 2007: the physical science basis (summary for policy makers), IPCC.</ref> Consequently, the debate has largely shifted onto ways to reduce further human impact and to find ways to adapt to change that has already occurred.<ref name="policies">See for example [[emissions trading]], [[cap and share]], [[personal carbon trading]], [[UNFCCC]]</ref>

Of most concern in these anthropogenic factors is the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> levels due to emissions from [[fossil fuel]] combustion, followed by [[particulate|aerosols]] (particulate matter in the atmosphere) and [[cement]] manufacture. Other factors, including land use, [[ozone depletion]], animal agriculture<ref name="Steinfeld2006">{{cite book | last = Steinfeld | first = H. | coauthors = P. Gerber, T. Wassenaar, V. Castel, M. Rosales, C. de Haan | title = Livestock's long shadow | year = 2006 | url = http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM}}</ref> and [[deforestation]], are also of concern in the roles they play - both separately and in conjunction with other factors - in affecting climate, [[microclimate]], and measures of climate variables.

== Physical evidence for climatic change ==
Evidence for climatic change is taken from a variety of sources that can be used to reconstruct past climates. Reasonably complete global records of surface temperature are available beginning from the mid-late 1800s.  For earlier periods, most of the evidence is indirect—climatic changes are inferred from changes in [[Proxy (climate)|proxies]], indicators that reflect climate, such as [[vegetation]], [[ice core]]s,<ref>{{cite journal | last = Petit | first = J.

=== Historical and archaeological evidence ===

{{main|Historical impacts of climate change}}

Climate change in the recent past may be detected by corresponding changes in settlement and agricultural patterns.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1126/science.1059827}}</ref> [[Archaeological]] evidence, [[oral history]] and [[historical documents]] can offer insights into past changes in the climate. Climate change effects have been linked to the collapse of various civilisations.<ref>{{cite doi|10.1126.2Fscience.1059827}}</ref>

=== Glaciers ===
[[File:Vostok-ice-core-petit.png|thumb|Variations in [[CO2|CO<sub>2</sub>]], temperature and dust from the [[Vostok, Antarctica|Vostok]] ice core over the last 450,000 years]]

[[Glacier]]s are considered among the most sensitive indicators of climate change,<ref name="Seiz2007">{{cite report| last = Seiz | first = G. | coauthors = N.

Glaciers grow and shrink, both contributing to natural variability and amplifying externally forced changes. A world glacier inventory has been compiled since the 1970s. Initially based mainly on aerial photographs and maps, this compilation has resulted in a detailed inventory of more than 100,000 glaciers covering a total area of approximately 240,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and, in preliminary estimates, for the recording of the remaining ice cover estimated to be around 445,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The World Glacier Monitoring Service collects data annually on [[glacier retreat]] and [[glacier mass balance]] From this data, glaciers worldwide have been found to be shrinking significantly, with strong glacier retreats in the 1940s, stable or growing conditions during the 1920s and 1970s, and again retreating from the mid 1980s to present.<ref name="Zemp2008">{{cite report| last = Zemp | first = M. | coauthors = I.Roer, A.Kääb, M.Hoelzle, F.Paul, W.

[[File:Glaciertermalp.JPG|thumb|left|Percentage of advancing glaciers in [[the Alps]] in the last 80 years]]
The most significant climate processes since the middle to late [[Pliocene]] (approximately 3 million years ago) are the glacial and [[interglacial]] cycles. The present interglacial period (the [[Holocene]]) has lasted about 11,700 years.<ref name="ICS2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/ISChart2008.pdf|format=PDF|title=International Stratigraphic Chart|year=2008|publisher=International Commission on Stratigraphy|accessdate=2009-07-22}}</ref> Shaped by [[Milankovitch cycles|orbital variations]], responses such as the rise and fall of [[Continental climate|continental]] ice sheets and significant sea-level changes helped create the climate. Other changes, including [[Heinrich event]]s, [[Dansgaard–Oeschger event]]s and the [[Younger Dryas]], however, illustrate how glacial variations may also influence climate without the [[Orbital forcing|forcing effect]] of orbital changes.

Glaciers leave behind [[moraine]]s that contain a wealth of material - including organic matter that may be accurately dated - recording the periods in which a glacier advanced and retreated. Similarly, by [[tephrochronology|tephrochronological]] techniques, the lack of glacier cover can be identified by the presence of soil or volcanic [[tephra]] horizons whose date of deposit may also be precisely ascertained.

=== Vegetation ===
A change in the type, distribution and coverage of vegetation may occur given a change in the climate; this much is obvious.  In any given scenario, a mild change in climate may result in increased precipitation and warmth, resulting in improved plant growth and the subsequent sequestration of airborne CO<sub>2</sub>. Larger, faster or more radical changes, however, may well{{Weasel-inline|date=March 2009}} result in vegetation stress, rapid plant loss and desertification in certain circumstances.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Bachelet | first = D| title = Climate Change Effects on Vegetation Distribution and Carbon Budget in the United States | journal = [[Ecosystems]] | volume = 4| pages = 164–185 | year = 2001 | url = http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/Library/nationalassessment/forests/Ecosystems2%20Bachelet.pdf |format=PDF| doi = 10.1007/s10021–001–0002-7 | accessdate = 2009-02-1-10 | doi_brokendate = 2009-09-18 | coauthors = R.Neilson,J.M.Lenihan,R.J.Drapek}}</ref>

=== Ice cores ===

Analysis of ice in a core drilled from a [[ice sheet]] such as the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], can be used to show a link between temperature and global sea level variations. The air trapped in bubbles in the ice can also reveal the CO<sub>2</sub> variations of the atmosphere from the distant past, well before modern environmental influences. The study of these ice cores has been a significant indicator of the changes in CO<sub>2</sub> over many millennia, and continues to provide valuable information about the differences between ancient and modern atmospheric conditions.

=== Dendroclimatology ===

[[Dendroclimatology]] is the analysis of tree ring growth patterns to determine past climate variations. Wide and thick rings indicate a fertile, well-watered growing period, whilst thin, narrow rings indicate a time of lower rainfall and less-than-ideal growing conditions.

=== Pollen analysis ===
[[Palynology]] is the study of contemporary and fossil [[palynomorph]]s, including [[pollen]]. Palynology is used to infer the geographical distribution of plant species, which vary under different climate conditions. Different groups of plants have [[pollen]] with distinctive shapes and surface textures, and since the outer surface of pollen is composed of a very resilient material, they resist decay. Changes in the type of pollen found in different sedimentation levels in lakes, bogs or river deltas indicate changes in plant communities; which are dependent on climate conditions.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Langdon | first = PG | title = Reconstructing climate and environmental change in northern England through chironomid and pollen analyses: evidence from Talkin Tarn, Cumbria | journal = Journal of Paleolimnology | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 197–213 | month = August | year = 2004 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/t7m324u675701133/ | accessdate = 2008-01-28 | doi = 10.1023/B:JOPL.0000029433.85764.a5 | author1 = Barber KE | author2 = , Lomas-Clarke SH | author-separator = ,}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Birks | first = HH | title = The importance of plant macrofossils in the reconstruction of Lateglacial vegetation and climate: examples from Scotland, western Norway, and Minnesota, USA | journal = Quarternary Science Reviews | volume = 22 | issue = 5-7 | pages = 453–473 | month = March | year = 2003 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VBC-47YH3W8-2/2/fde5760538b5b3adb92d8564ea968b9a | accessdate = 2008-01-28 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-3791(02)00248-2}}</ref>

=== Insects ===
Remains of [[beetle]]s are common in freshwater and land sediments. Different species of beetles tend to be found under different climatic conditions. Given the extensive lineage of beetles whose genetic makeup has not altered significantly over the millennia, knowledge of the present climatic range of the different species, and the age of the sediments in which remains are found, past climatic conditions may be inferred.<ref name=Coope1999>{{cite journal | last = Coope | first = G.R. | title = Temperature gradients in northern Europe during the last glacial—Holocene transition(14–9 14 C kyr BP) interpreted from coleopteran assemblages | journal = [[Journal of Quaternary Science]] | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 419–433 | publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. | date = 1999-05-04 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/61001707/ABSTRACT | accessdate = 2008-02-18 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1417(1998090)13:5<419::AID-JQS410>3.0.CO;2-D | coauthors = Lemdahl, G.; Lowe, J.J.; Walkling, A.}}</ref>

=== Sea level change ===
{{main|Current sea level rise}}
Global sea level change for much of the last century has generally been estimated using [[tide gauge]] measurements collated over long periods of time to give a long-term average. More recently, [[altimeter]] measurements — in combination with accurately determined [[satellite]] orbits — have provided an improved measurement of global sea level change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sealevel.colorado.edu/documents.php|title=Sea Level Change|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder|accessdate=2009-07-21}}</ref>
