'''Climate change''' is a change in the statistical distribution of [[weather]] over [[duration|periods of time]] that range from decades to millions of years. It can be a change in the average weather or a change in the distribution of weather events around an average (for example, greater or fewer extreme weather events). Climate change may be limited to a specific [[region]], or may occur across the whole [[Earth]].  It can be caused by recurring, often cyclical [[climate pattern]]s such as [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]], or come in the form of more singular events such as the [[Dust Bowl]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.oar.noaa.gov/climate/t_observing.html|title=

In recent usage, especially in the context of [[environmental policy]], climate change usually refers to changes in modern [[climate]]. It may be qualified as [[anthropogenic]] climate change, more generally known as &quot;[[global warming]]&quot; or &quot;[[anthropogenic]] global warming&quot; ([[Global warming|AGW]]).

For information on temperature measurements over various periods, and the data sources available, see [[temperature record]]. For attribution of climate change over the past century, see [[attribution of recent climate change]].

<h level="2" i="1">== Causes ==</h>
Factors that can shape climate are [[climate forcing]]s. These include such processes as variations in [[solar radiation]], deviations in the Earth's [[orbit]], [[orogenesis|mountain-building]] and [[continental drift]], and changes in [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations. There are a variety of [[Global warming#Feedback|climate change feedbacks]] that can either amplify or diminish the initial forcing. Some parts of the climate system, such as the oceans and ice caps, respond slowly in reaction to climate forcing because of their large mass. Therefore, the climate system can take centuries or longer to fully respond to new external forcings.

<h level="3" i="2">=== Plate tectonics ===</h>

Over the course of millions of years, the motion of tectonic plates reconfigures global land and ocean areas and generates topography. This can affect both global and local patterns of climate and atmosphere-ocean circulation.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite doi|10.1130/0016-7606(1999)111&lt;0497:PIAPAB&gt;2.3.CO;2}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

The position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and therefore influences patterns of ocean circulation. The locations of the seas are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the globe, and therefore, in determining global climate. A recent example of tectonic control on ocean circulation is the formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] about 5 million years ago, which shut off direct mixing between the [[Atlantic]] and [[Pacific]] Oceans. This strongly affected the [[western boundary current|ocean dynamics]] of what is now the [[Gulf Stream]] and may have led to Northern Hemisphere ice cover.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=16401 | title=Panama: Isthmus that Changed the World | accessdate=2008-07-01 | publisher=[[NASA]] Earth Observatory }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=2508|title=How the Isthmus of Panama Put Ice in the Arctic|last=Gerald H.|first=Haug|date=2004-03-22|publisher=WHOI: Oceanus|accessdate=2009-07-21}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Earlier, during the [[Carboniferous]] period, plate tectonics may have triggered the large-scale storage of carbon and increased glaciation.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal|title=Isotope stratigraphy of the European Carboniferous: proxy signals for ocean chemistry, climate and tectonics| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V5Y-3XNK494-8&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=7db7616e9dc94e6ed49a817195926851|journal=Chemical Geology|date=1999-09-30|volume=161|issue=1-3|doi=10.1016/S0009-2541(99)00084-4|page=127|author1=Peter Bruckschen|author2=Susanne Oesmanna|author3=Ján Veizer|author-separator=,}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Geologic evidence points to a &quot;megamonsoonal&quot; circulation pattern during the time of the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]], and climate modeling suggests that the existence of the supercontinent was conducive to the establishment of monsoons.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal|author=Judith T.

More locally, topography can influence climate. The existence of mountains (as a product of plate tectonics through [[orogenesis|mountain-building]]) can cause [[orographic precipitation]]. Humidity generally decreases and diurnal temperature swings generally increase with increasing elevation. Mean temperature and the length of the growing season also decrease with increasing elevation. This, along with orographic precipitation, is important for the existence of low-latitude [[alpine glacier]]s and the varied flora and fauna along at different elevations in montane [[ecosystem]]s.

The size of continents is also important. Because of the stabilizing effect of the oceans on temperature, yearly temperature variations are generally lower in coastal areas than they are inland. A larger supercontinent will therefore have more area in which climate is strongly seasonal than will several smaller continents and/or [[island arc]]s.

<template lineStart="1"><title>main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Milankovitch cycles</value></part></template>

Slight variations in Earth's [[orbit]] lead to changes in the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface and how it is distributed across the globe. There is very little change to the area-averaged annually-averaged sunshine; but there can be strong changes in the geographical and seasonal distribution. The three types of orbital variations are variations in Earth's [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]], changes in [[axial tilt|the tilt angle of Earth's axis of rotation]], and [[precession]] of Earth's axis. Combined together, these produce [[Milankovitch cycles]] which have a large impact on climate and are notable for their correlation to [[glacial period|glacial]] and [[interglacial period]]s,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;msu milankovitch&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.homepage.montana.edu/~geol445/hyperglac/time1/milankov.htm|title= Milankovitch Cycles and Glaciation|accessdate=2009-04-02|publisher= University of Montana}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> their correlation with the advance and retreat of the [[Sahara]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;msu milankovitch&quot; </attr></ext> and for their [[cyclostratigraphy|appearance]] in the [[geologic record|stratigraphic record]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1365-3121.1989.tb00403.x|title=A Milankovitch scale for Cenomanian time|year=1989|author=Gale, Andrew S.|journal=Terra Nova|volume=1|pages=420}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

[[Volcanism]] is a process of conveying material from the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] and [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] of the Earth to its surface. Volcanic eruptions, [[geysers]], and [[hot springs]], are examples of volcanic processes which release gases and/or [[particulates]] into the atmosphere.

[[Volcano|Eruption]]s large enough to affect climate occur on average several times per century, and cause cooling (by partially blocking the transmission of [[solar radiation]] to the Earth's surface) for a period of a few years.

[[File:Ocean circulation conveyor belt.jpg|thumb|A schematic of modern [[thermohaline]] circulation]]

The ocean is a fundamental part of the climate system. Short-term fluctuations (years to a few decades) such as the [[ENSO|El Niño–Southern Oscillation]], the [[Pacific decadal oscillation]], the [[North Atlantic oscillation]], and the [[Arctic oscillation]], represent climate variability rather than climate change. On longer time scales, alterations to ocean processes such as [[thermohaline circulation]] play a key role in redistributing heat by carrying out a very slow and extremely deep movement of [[water]], and the long-term redistribution of [[heat]] in the world's oceans.

<h level="3" i="7">=== Human influences ===</h>
<template lineStart="1"><title>main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Global warming</value></part></template>

Anthropogenic factors are human activities that change the environment. In some cases the chain of causality of human influence on the climate is direct and unambiguous (for example, the effects of irrigation on local humidity), while in other instances it is less clear. Various hypotheses for human-induced climate change have been argued for many years. Presently the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus on climate change]] is that human activity is very likely the cause for the rapid increase in global average temperatures over the past several decades.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;IPCC1&quot;</attr><inner>IPCC.

Of most concern in these anthropogenic factors is the increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels due to emissions from [[fossil fuel]] combustion, followed by [[particulate|aerosols]] (particulate matter in the atmosphere) and [[cement]] manufacture. Other factors, including land use, [[ozone depletion]], animal agriculture<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Steinfeld2006&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book | last = Steinfeld | first = H. | coauthors = P.

Glaciers leave behind [[moraine]]s that contain a wealth of material - including organic matter that may be accurately dated - recording the periods in which a glacier advanced and retreated.

A change in the type, distribution and coverage of vegetation may occur given a change in the climate; this much is obvious.

Larger, faster or more radical changes, however, may well<template><title>Weasel-inline</title><part><name>date</name><equals>=</equals><value>March 2009</value></part></template> result in vegetation stress, rapid plant loss and desertification in certain circumstances.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal | last = Bachelet | first = D| title = Climate Change Effects on Vegetation Distribution and Carbon Budget in the United States | journal = [[Ecosystems]] | volume = 4| pages = 164–185 | year = 2001 | url = http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/Library/nationalassessment/forests/Ecosystems2%20Bachelet.pdf |format=PDF| doi = 10.1007/s10021–001–0002-7 | accessdate = 2009-02-1-10 | doi_brokendate = 2009-09-18 | coauthors = R.Neilson,J.M.Lenihan,R.J.Drapek}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="3" i="12">=== Ice cores ===</h>

Analysis of ice in a core drilled from a [[ice sheet]] such as the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], can be used to show a link between temperature and global sea level variations. The air trapped in bubbles in the ice can also reveal the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; variations of the atmosphere from the distant past, well before modern environmental influences. The study of these ice cores has been a significant indicator of the changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over many millennia, and continues to provide valuable information about the differences between ancient and modern atmospheric conditions.

<h level="3" i="13">=== Dendroclimatology ===</h>

[[Dendroclimatology]] is the analysis of tree ring growth patterns to determine past climate variations. Wide and thick rings indicate a fertile, well-watered growing period, whilst thin, narrow rings indicate a time of lower rainfall and less-than-ideal growing conditions.

<h level="3" i="14">=== Pollen analysis ===</h>
[[Palynology]] is the study of contemporary and fossil [[palynomorph]]s, including [[pollen]]. Palynology is used to infer the geographical distribution of plant species, which vary under different climate conditions. Different groups of plants have [[pollen]] with distinctive shapes and surface textures, and since the outer surface of pollen is composed of a very resilient material, they resist decay. Changes in the type of pollen found in different sedimentation levels in lakes, bogs or river deltas indicate changes in plant communities; which are dependent on climate conditions.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal | last = Langdon | first = PG | title = Reconstructing climate and environmental change in northern England through chironomid and pollen analyses: evidence from Talkin Tarn, Cumbria | journal = Journal of Paleolimnology | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 197–213 | month = August | year = 2004 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/t7m324u675701133/ | accessdate = 2008-01-28 | doi = 10.1023/B:JOPL.0000029433.85764.a5 | author1 = Barber KE | author2 = , Lomas-Clarke SH | author-separator = ,}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal | last = Birks | first = HH | title = The importance of plant macrofossils in the reconstruction of Lateglacial vegetation and climate: examples from Scotland, western Norway, and Minnesota, USA | journal = Quarternary Science Reviews | volume = 22 | issue = 5-7 | pages = 453–473 | month = March | year = 2003 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6VBC-47YH3W8-2/2/fde5760538b5b3adb92d8564ea968b9a | accessdate = 2008-01-28 | doi = 10.1016/S0277-3791(02)00248-2}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="3" i="15">=== Insects ===</h>
Remains of [[beetle]]s are common in freshwater and land sediments. Different species of beetles tend to be found under different climatic conditions. Given the extensive lineage of beetles whose genetic makeup has not altered significantly over the millennia, knowledge of the present climatic range of the different species, and the age of the sediments in which remains are found, past climatic conditions may be inferred.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Coope1999</attr><inner>{{cite journal | last = Coope | first = G.R. | title = Temperature gradients in northern Europe during the last glacial—Holocene transition(14–9 14 C kyr BP) interpreted from coleopteran assemblages | journal = [[Journal of Quaternary Science]] | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 419–433 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. | date = 1999-05-04 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/61001707/ABSTRACT | accessdate = 2008-02-18 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1099-1417(1998090)13:5&lt;419::AID-JQS410&gt;3.0.CO;2-D | coauthors = Lemdahl, G.; Lowe, J.J.; Walkling, A.}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Global sea level change for much of the last century has generally been estimated using [[tide gauge]] measurements collated over long periods of time to give a long-term average. More recently, [[altimeter]] measurements — in combination with accurately determined [[satellite]] orbits — have provided an improved measurement of global sea level change.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://sealevel.colorado.edu/documents.php|title=Sea Level Change|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder|accessdate=2009-07-21}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>
