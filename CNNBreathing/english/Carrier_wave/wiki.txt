In [[telecommunications]], a '''carrier wave''', '''carrier signal''', or just '''carrier''', is a [[waveform]] (usually [[sinusoidal]]) that is [[Modulation|modulated]] (modified) with an  [[signal (electrical engineering)|input signal]] for the purpose of conveying information.<ref>{{citeweb|title=Carrier wave with no modulation transports no information.|url=http://www.utexas.edu/research/cemd/nim/Agif/CarrWave.html|publisher=''[[University Of Texas]]''|accessdate=2008-05-30}}</ref> This carrier wave is usually a much higher [[frequency]] than the input signal.  The purpose of the carrier is usually either to transmit the information through space as an [[electromagnetic wave]] (as in radio communication), or to allow several carriers at different frequencies to share a common physical transmission medium by [[frequency division multiplexing]] (as, for example, a [[cable television]] system). The term is also used for an unmodulated [[Emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] in the absence of any modulating signal.<ref>[[Federal Standard 1037C]] and [[MIL-STD-188]]</ref>
  
[[Frequency modulation]] (FM) and [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) are common modes of modulating the carrier.  In the case of [[single-sideband modulation]] (SSB), the carrier is suppressed (and in some forms of SSB, eliminated). The carrier must be reintroduced at the receiver by a [[beat frequency oscillator]] (BFO). The frequency of a radio or television station is actually the carrier wave's [[center frequency]].

== Carrierless modulation systems == 
Newer forms of radio communication (such as [[spread spectrum]] and [[ultra-wideband]]) do not use a conventional sinusoidal carrier wave, nor does [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|OFDM]] (which is used in [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] and in the European standard for [[High-definition television|HDTV]]).
* [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|OFDM]] may be thought of as an array of symmetrical carrier waves. The rules governing carrier-wave propagation affect OFDM differently from [[8VSB]].
* Some forms of [[spread spectrum]] transmission (and most forms of [[ultra-wideband]]) are mathematically defined as being devoid of carrier waves. Transmitter implementations typically produce residual carriers which may (or may not) be detectable or transmitted.

== Carrier leakage ==
Carrier leakage is interference caused by cross-talk or a DC offset. It is present as an unmodulated sine wave within the signal's bandwidth, whose amplitude is independent of the signal's amplitude. See [[frequency mixer]]s, to read further about carrier leakage or local oscillator feedthrough.
