The immature stages can differ from the adults in structure, habit and habitat and can include a passive [[pupa]]l stage in those groups that undergo [[complete metamorphosis]].

Fossilized insects of enormous size have been found from the [[Paleozoic|Paleozoic Era]], including giant dragonflies with wingspans of 55 to 70 [[centimetre|cm]] (22–28 [[inch|in]]). The most diverse insect groups appear to have [[coevolution|coevolved]] with flowering [[plant]]s.

Insects typically move about by walking, flying or occasionally sinking and swimming at the same time. Because it allows for rapid yet stable movement, many insects adopt a tripedal gait in which they walk with their legs touching the ground in alternating triangles. Insects are the only invertebrates to have evolved flight. Many insects spend at least part of their life underwater, with [[larval]] adaptations that include [[gill]]s and some adult insects are aquatic and have adaptations for swimming. Some species, like [[Gerridae|water strider]]s, are capable of walking on the surface of water. 

Insects are mostly solitary, but some insects, such as certain [[bee]]s, [[ant]]s, and [[termite]]s are social and live in large, well-organized colonies. Some insects, like [[earwig]]s, show maternal care, guarding their eggs and young. Insects can communicate with each other in a variety of ways. Male [[moth]]s can sense the [[pheromone]]s of female moths over distances of many kilometers. Other species communicate with sounds: crickets [[Stridulation|stridulate]], or rub their wings together, to attract a mate and repel other males. [[Firefly|Lampyridae]] in the beetle order Coleoptera communicate with light.

Humans regard certain insects as [[Pest (organism)|pest]]s and attempt to control them using [[insecticide]]s and a host of other techniques. Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap, leaves or [[fruit]]s, a few bite humans and livestock, alive and dead, to feed on blood and some are capable of transmitting [[disease]]s to humans, pets and livestock. Many other insects are considered ecologically beneficial and a few provide direct economic benefit. [[Silkworm]]s and bees have been [[domestication|domesticated]] by humans for the production of [[silk]] and [[honey]], respectively.

<h level="3" i="2">===General body plan===</h>
Insects have [[segmentation (biology)|segment]]ed bodies supported by an [[exoskeleton]], a hard outer covering made mostly of [[chitin]]. The segments of the body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or [[tagma (biology)|tagmata]]: a head, a [[thorax]], and an [[abdomen]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | title=O.

The thorax has six segmented [[arthropod leg|leg]]s—one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax—and, if present in the species, two or four [[insect wing|wing]]s. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the [[digestion|digestive]], [[Respiration (physiology)|respiratory]], [[Excretion|excretory]] and reproductive internal structures.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gullan and Cranston&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book |last=Gullan |first=P.J. |coauthors=P.S.

<h level="3" i="3">===Exoskeleton===</h>
Insect outer skeleton, the cuticle, is made up of two layers: the [[epicuticle]], which is a thin and waxy water resistant outer layer and contains no chitin, and a lower layer called the [[procuticle]]. The procuticle is chitinous and much thicker than the epicuticle and has two layers: an outer layer known as the exocuticle and an inner layer known as the endocuticle. The tough and flexible endocuticle is built from numerous layers of fibrous chitin and proteins, criss-crossing each others in a sandwich pattern, while the exocuticle is rigid and [[sclerotization|hardened]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gullan and Cranston&quot; </attr></ext><template><title>Rp</title><part><name index="1"/><value>22–24</value></part></template> The exocuticle is greatly reduced in many soft-bodied insects (e.g., [[caterpillar]]s), especially during their [[larva]]l stages.

Having their muscles attached to their exoskeletons is more efficient and allows more muscle connections; [[crustacean]]s also use the same method, though all [[spider]]s use [[hydraulic]] pressure to extend their legs, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. Unlike insects, though, most aquatic crustaceans are [[biomineralization|biomineralized]] with [[calcium carbonate]] extracted from the water.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Cite book | author=Barnes, R.S.K., Calow, P., Olive, P., Golding, D., and Spicer, J.| title=The Invertebrates: A Synthesis | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | year=2001 | isbn=0632047615 | chapter=Invertebrates with Legs: the Arthropods and Similar Groups | page=168| url=http://books.google.com/?id=TBMsbe9efPgC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=arthropod+hydraulic | accessdate=2008-09-25}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Cite book | author=Lowenstam, H.A., and Weiner, S. | title=On biomineralization| publisher=Oxford University Press US | year=1989 | isbn=0195049772| page=111 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=JbAgy0AAopsC&amp;dq=arthropod+biomineralization | accessdate=2008-09-25}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="3" i="4">===Nervous system===</h>
The [[nervous system]] of an insect can be divided into a brain and a [[ventral nerve cord]]. The head capsule, made up of six fused segments, each with a pair of [[ganglion|ganglia]], or a cluster of nerve cells outside of the brain. The first three pairs of ganglia are fused into the brain, while the three following pairs are fused into a structure of three pairs of ganglia under the insect's [[esophagus]], called the [[subesophageal ganglion]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gullan and Cranston&quot; </attr></ext><template><title>Rp</title><part><name index="1"/><value>57</value></part></template>

The thoracic segments have one ganglion on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment. This arrangement is also seen in the abdomen but only in the first eight segments. Many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or reduction.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;INSECTS: ROLE OF THE SPIRACLES&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1539265|last=Schneiderman|first=Howard A.|year=1960|title=Discontinuous respiration in insects: role of the spiracles|journal=Biol.

<h level="3" i="5">===Digestive system===</h>
An insect uses its digestive system to extract nutrients and other substances from the food it consumes.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;genent&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web | title=General Entomology - Digestive and Excritory system | url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/library/tutorials/internal_anatomy/digestive.html | work= | publisher=NC state University | date= | accessdate=2009-05-03}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Most of this food is ingested in the form of [[macromolecule]]s and other complex substances like [[protein]]s, [[polysaccharide]]s, [[fat]]s, and [[nucleic acid]]s. These macromolecules must be broken down by [[catabolism|catabolic reaction]]s into smaller molecules like [[amino acid]]s and [[simple sugar]]s before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion.

The main structure of an insect's digestive system is a long enclosed tube called the [[alimentary canal]], which runs lengthwise through the body. The alimentary canal directs food unidirectionally from the [[mouth]] to the [[anus]]. It has three sections, each of which performs a different process of digestion. In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax, adjacent to the foregut.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gullan and Cranston&quot; </attr></ext><template><title>Rp</title><part><name index="1"/><value>70–77</value></part></template>

The [[salivary gland]]s (element 30 in numbered diagram) in an insect's mouth produce saliva. The salivary ducts lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium, located behind the hypopharynx. By moving its mouthparts (element 32 in numbered diagram) the insect can mix its food with saliva. The mixture of saliva and food then travels through the salivary tubes into the mouth, where it begins to break down.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;genent&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web | title=General Entomology – Digestive and Excretory system | url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/library/tutorials/internal_anatomy/digestive.html | work= | publisher=NC state University | date= | accessdate=2009-05-03}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book |last=Duncan |first=Carl D. |coauthors= |title=A Contribution to The Biology of North American Vespine Wasps|publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford|year=1939 |edition=1 |pages=24–29|isbn=}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Some insects, like [[Diptera|flies]], have [[Mastication|extra-oral digestion]].

<h level="5" i="6">=====Foregut=====</h>
[[Image:Malpighian tube.svg|thumb|250px|right|Stylized diagram of insect digestive tract showing [[Malpighian tubule system|malpighian tubule]], from an insect of the order [[Orthoptera]].]]
The first section of the alimentary canal is the [[foregut]] (element 27 in numbered diagram), or stomodaeum. The foregut is line with a cuticular lining made of [[chitin]] and [[protein]]s as protection from tough food. The foregut includes the [[buccal cavity]] (mouth), [[pharynx]], [[esophagus]], and [[crop]] and [[proventriculus]] (any part may be highly modified) which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gullan and Cranston&quot; </attr></ext><template><title>Rp</title><part><name index="1"/><value>70</value></part></template> Here, digestion starts as partially chewed food is broken down by saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and [[enzyme|carbohydrate-digesting enzyme]]s (mostly [[amylase]]s), strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the buccal cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and xylem and phloem feeders.

From there, the pharynx passes food to the esophagus, which could be just a simple tube passing it on to the crop and proventriculus, and then on ward to the midgut, as in most insects. Alternately, the foregut may expand into a very enlarged crop and proventriculus, or the crop could just be a [[diverticulum]], or fluid filled structure, as in some Diptera species.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Insect Physiology and Biochemistry &quot;</attr></ext><template><title>Rp</title><part><name index="1"/><value>30–31</value></part></template>

[[Image:Bee Squirt.gif|thumb|250px|left|[[Bee]] defecating. Note the extension of the [[anus]].]]

<h level="5" i="7">=====Midgut=====</h>
Once food leaves the crop, it passes to the [[stomach|midgut]] (element 13 in numbered diagram), also known as the mesenteron, where the majority of digestion takes place. Microscopic projections from the midgut wall, called [[microvillus|microvilli]], increase the surface area of the wall and allow more nutrients to be absorbed; they tend to be close to the origin of the midgut. In some insects, the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary. For example, specialized microvilli producing digestive enzymes may more likely be near the end of the midgut, and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Insect Physiology and Biochemistry &quot;</attr></ext><template><title>Rp</title><part><name index="1"/><value>32</value></part></template>

<h level="5" i="8">=====Hindgut=====</h>
In the [[hindgut]] (element 16 in numbered diagram), or proctodaeum, undigested food particles are joined by [[uric acid]] to form fecal pellets. The rectum absorbs 90% of the water in these fecal pellets, and the dry pellet is then eliminated through the anus (element 17), completing the process of digestion. The uric acid is formed using hemolymph waste products diffused from the [[Malpighian tubule system|Malpighian tubule]]s (element 20). It is then emptied directly into the alimentary canal, at the junction between the midgut and hindgut. The number of Malpighian tubules possessed by a given insect varies between species, ranging from only two tubules in some insects to over 100 tubules in others.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gullan and Cranston&quot; </attr></ext><template><title>Rp</title><part><name index="1"/><value>71–72, 78–80</value></part></template>

<h level="3" i="9">===Respiration and circulation===</h>
[[Respiratory system#Anatomy_in_invertebrates|Insect respiration]] is accomplished without [[lung]]s. Instead, the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their [[invertebrate trachea|trachea]] (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no [[vein]]s or [[artery|arterie]]s, and instead consists of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses [[peristalsis|peristaltically]]. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart. The opposite end of the dorsal tube is like the aorta of the insect circulating the [[hemolymph]], arthropods' fluid analog of [[blood]], inside the body cavity.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gullan and Cranston&quot; </attr></ext><template><title>Rp</title><part><name index="1"/><value>61–65</value></part></template><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.cals.ncsu.edu/course/ent425/tutorial/circulatory.html|title=Circulatory System|last=Meyer |first=John R. |date=17 February 2006|publisher=Department of Entomology, NC State University|pages=1|accessdate=2009-10-11|location=NC State University}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Air is taken in through openings on the sides of the abdomen called [[spiracle]]s.

The majority of insects hatch from [[egg (biology)|egg]]s.  The fertilization and development takes place inside the egg, enclosed by a shell ([[chorion]]).  Some species of insects, like the cockroach ''[[Blaptica dubia]]'', as well as juvenile aphids and tsetse flies, are [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]].

<h level="3" i="11">===Metamorphosis===</h>
[[Metamorphosis]] in insects is the biological process of development all insects must undergo. There are two forms of metamorphosis: incomplete metamorphosis and complete metamorphosis.

<h level="4" i="12">====Incomplete metamorphosis====</h>
<template lineStart="1"><title>main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Hemimetabolism</value></part></template>
Insects that show [[hemimetabolism]], or incomplete metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing a series of [[ecdysis|molt]]s. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] secretes a new [[epicuticle]]. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the endocuticle and thus detaches the old cuticle. When this stage is complete, the insect makes its body swell by taking in a large quantity of water or air, which makes the old cuticle split along predefined weaknesses where the old exocuticle was thinnest.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gullan and Cranston&quot; </attr></ext><template><title>Rp</title><part><name index="1"/><value>142</value></part></template><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;RuppertFoxBarnes2004P523To524&quot;</attr><inner>{{Cite book | author=Ruppert, E.E., Fox, R.S., and Barnes, R.D. | title=Invertebrate Zoology | publisher=Brooks / Cole | edition=7 | isbn=0030259827 | year=2004 | pages=523–524 
}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Other arthropods have a much different process and only molt; though must accommodate for the difference in exoskeleton structure and make up with other enzymes. 

Immature insects that go through incomplete metamorphosis are called [[Nymph (biology)|nymph]]s or in the case of dragonflies and damselflies as [[Naiad (biology)|naiad]]s. Nymphs are similar in form to the adult except for the presence of wings, which are not developed until adulthood. With each molt, nymphs grow larger and become more similar in appearance to adult insects.

[[File:Gulf Fritillary Life Cycle.svg|250px|thumb|right|[[Gulf Fritillary]] life cycle, an example of [[holometabolism]].]]
[[Holometabolism]], or complete metamorphosis, is where the insect changes all in four stages, an [[Egg (biology)|egg]] or [[embryo]], a [[larva]], a [[pupa]], and the [[adult]] or [[imago]]. In these species, egg hatches to produce a [[larva]], which is generally worm-like in form. This worm-like form can be one of several varieties: eruciform (caterpillar-like), scarabaeiform (grub-like), campodeiform (elongated, flattened, and active), elateriform (wireworm-like) or vermiform (maggot-like). The larva grows and eventually becomes a [[pupa]], a stage marked by reduced movement and often sealed within a [[pupa|cocoon]]. There are three types of pupae: obtect, exarate or coarctate. Obtect pupae are compact, with the legs and other appendages enclosed. Exarate pupae have their legs and other appendages free and extended. Coarctate pupae develop inside the larval skin.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gullan and Cranston&quot; </attr></ext><template><title>Rp</title><part><name index="1"/><value>151</value></part></template> Insects undergo considerable change in form during the pupal stage, and emerge as adults. Butterflies are a well known example of an insects that undergo complete metamorphosis, although most insects use this life cycle. Some insects have evolved this system to [[hypermetamorphosis]].

Some of the oldest and most successful insect groups, such [[Endopterygota]], use a system of complete metamorphosis.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gullan and Cranston&quot; </attr></ext><template><title>Rp</title><part><name index="1"/><value>143</value></part></template> Strangely though, complete metamorphosis is unique to certain insect orders, like [[Diptera]], [[Lepidoptera]], and [[Hymenoptera]], and no other arthropods undergo it, but incomplete metamorphosis.

<h level="2" i="14">==Senses and communication==</h>
Many insects possess very sensitive and/or specialized organs of [[sense|perception]]. Some insects such as [[bees]] can perceive [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths, or detect [[polarized light]], while the [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] of male moths can detect the [[pheromone]]s of female moths over distances of many kilometers.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://crazydaz.com/insects.pdf |title=Insects|publisher=Alien Life Forms|pages=4|accessdate=2009-05-17}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice-versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects perceive sound, while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying [[Animal hearing|hearing]], though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2&amp;nbsp;MHz., and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50&amp;nbsp;MHz.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal | last=Cator | first=L.

The mother wasp lays her eggs in individual cells and provides each egg with a number of live caterpillars on which the young feed when hatched. Some species of wasp always provide five, others twelve, and others as high as twenty-four caterpillars per cell. The number of caterpillars is different among species, but always the same for each sex of larva. The male solitary wasp in the genus ''[[Eumenes (genus)|Eumenes]]'' is smaller than the female, so the mother of one species supplies him with only five caterpillars; the larger female receives ten caterpillars in her cell.

Very low sounds are also produced in various species of [[Coleoptera]], [[Hymenoptera]], [[Lepidoptera]], [[Mantodea]], and [[Neuroptera]]. These low sounds are simply the sounds made by the insect's movement. Through microscopic stridulatory structures located on the insect's muscles and joints, the normal sounds of the insect moving are amplified and can be used to warn or communicate with other insects. Most sound-making insects also have [[tympanal organ]]s that can perceive airborne sounds.

Communication using surface-borne vibrational signals is more widespread among insects because of size constraints in producing air-borne sounds. When compared with the size of the insects, communication range can be up to 1000 times the length of the body. So in order to surface-borne vibrational signals, insects of smaller size will use surface-borne vibrational signals, but it is also less diffuse and the signal is confined within the surface and is therefore on one hand easier to locate, but on the other hand is also less likely to

In addition to the use of sound for communication, a wide range of insects have evolved chemical means for communication. These chemicals, termed [[semiochemical]]s, are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract, repel and provide other kinds of information. [[Pheromone]]s, a type of semiochemical, are used for attracting mates of the opposite sex, for aggregating [[conspecificity|conspecific]] individuals of both sexes, for deterring other individuals from approaching, to mark a trail, and to trigger aggression in nearby individuals. [[Allomone]]a benefit their producer by the effect they have upon the receiver. [[Kairomone]]s benefit their receiver instead of their producer. Synomones benefit the producer and the receiver. While some chemicals are targeted at individuals of the same species, others are used for communication across species. The use of scents is especially well known to have developed in social insects.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gullan and Cranston&quot; </attr></ext><template><title>Rp</title><part><name index="1"/><value>96–105</value></part></template>

Only insects which live in nests or colonies demonstrate any true capacity for fine-scale spatial orientation or homing. This can allow an insect to return unerringly to a single hole a few millimeters in diameter among thousands of apparently identical holes clustered together, after a trip of up to several kilometers' distance. In a phenomenon known as [[philopatry]], insects that [[hibernation|hibernate]] have shown the ability to recall a specific location up to a year after last viewing the area of interest.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal|last=Salt|first=R.W.|date=January 1961|title=Principles of Insect Cold-Hardiness|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|publisher=Canada Agriculture Research Station|location=Lethbirdge, Alberta, Canada|url=http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.en.06.010161.000415|doi=10.1146/annurev.en.06.010161.000415|volume=6|pages=55}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> A few insects seasonally [[Insect migration|migrate]] large distances between different geographic regions (e.g., the overwintering areas of the [[Monarch butterfly]]).<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gullan and Cranston&quot; </attr></ext><template><title>Rp</title><part><name index="1"/><value>14</value></part></template>

Most insects lead short lives as adults, and rarely interact with one another except to mate or compete for mates. A small number exhibit some form of [[parental care]], where they will at least guard their eggs, and sometimes continue guarding their offspring until adulthood, and possibly even feeding them. Another simple form of parental care is to construct a nest (a burrow or an actual construction, either of which may be simple or complex), store provisions in it, and lay an egg upon those provisions. The adult does not contact the growing offspring, but it nonetheless does provide food. This sort of care is typical of bees and various types of wasps.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | title=Social Insects | url=http://www.ndsu.nodak.edu/entomology/topics/societies.htm | work= | publisher=North Dakota State University | date= | accessdate=2009-10-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080321171246/http://www.ndsu.nodak.edu/entomology/topics/societies.htm |archivedate = March 21, 2008}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Insects are the only group of invertebrates to have developed flight. The evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate. Some [[entomology|entomologist]]s suggest that the wings are from paranotal lobes, or extensions from the insect's exoskeleton called the [[notum|nota]], called the ''paranotal theory''. Other theories are based on a pleural origin. The pleuron is membrane on the sides of the thorax. These theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills, spiracular flaps or as from an appendage of the epicoxa. The ''epicoxal theory'' suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites, a modified appendage at the base of the legs or [[arthropod leg|coxa]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal | title=Hypothesis testing in evolutionary developmental biology: a case study from insect wings | last1=Jockusch | first1=EL | last2=Ober | first2=KA | journal=Journal of Heredity | year=2004 | month=September | volume=95 | issue=5 | pages=382–396 | doi=10.1093/jhered/esh064 | pmid=15388766}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> In the Carboniferous age, some of the ''[[Meganeura]]'' dragonflies had as much as a <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>50</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>cm</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>in</value></part><part><name>abbr</name><equals>=</equals><value>on</value></part></template> wide wingspan.

<h level="3" i="22">===Walking===</h>
Many adult insects use six legs for walking and have adopted a [[tripedal]] [[gait]]. The tripedal gait allows for rapid walking while always having a stable stance and has been studied extensively in [[cockroach]]es. The legs are used in alternate triangles touching the ground. For the first step, the middle right leg and the front and rear left legs are in contact with the ground and move the insect forward, while the front and rear right leg and the middle left leg are lifted and moved forward to a new position. When they touch the ground to form a new stable triangle the other legs can be lifted and brought forward in turn and so on.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Locomotion&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book | last=Biewener | first=Andrew A | title=Animal Locomotion | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2003 | isbn=0-19-850022-X}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The purest form of the tripedal gait is seen in insects moving at high speeds. However, this type of locomotion is not rigid and insects can adapt a variety of gaits. For example, when moving slowly, turning, or avoiding obstacles, four or more feet may be touching the ground. Insects can also adapt their gait to cope with the loss of one or more limbs. 

Cockroaches are among the fastest insect runners and, at full speed, adopt a bipedal run to reach a high velocity in proportion to their body size. As cockroaches move very quickly, they need to be video recorded at several hundred frames per second to reveal their gait. More sedate locomotion is seen in the stick insects or walking sticks ([[Phasmatodea]]). A few insects have evolved to walk on the surface of the water, especially the bugs of the [[Water strider|Gerridae]] family, commonly known as water striders. A few species of ocean-skaters in the genus ''[[Halobates]]'' even live on the surface of open oceans, a habitat that has few insect species.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal|author=Ikawa, Terumi,; Okabe, Hidehiko; Hoshizaki, Sugihiko; Kamikado, Takahiro; Cheng, Lanna| title= Distribution of the oceanic insects ''Halobates'' (Hemiptera: Gerridae) off the south coast of Japan | journal= Entomological Science | volume=7| issue=4| pages= 351–357 |year=2004| doi=10.1111/j.1479-8298.2004.00083.x}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

The higher-level [[phylogeny]] of the arthropods continues to be a matter of debate and research.

The origins of [[insect flight]] remain obscure, since the earliest winged insects currently known appear to have been capable fliers. Some extinct insects had an additional pair of winglets attaching to the first segment of the thorax, for a total of three pairs. As of 2009, there is no evidence that suggests that the insects were a particularly successful group of animals before they evolved to have wings.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book | author=[[David Grimaldi|Grimaldi, D.]] and [[Michael S.

This gigantism may have been due to higher atmospheric oxygen levels that allowed increased respiratory efficiency relative to today. The lack of flying vertebrates could have been another factor. Most extinct orders of insects developed during the Permian era that began around 270 million years ago. Many of the early groups became extinct during the [[Permian-Triassic extinction event]], the largest mass extinction in the history of the Earth, around 252 million years ago.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;History of Insects&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book|author=[[Alex Rasnitsyn|Rasnitsyn, A.P.]] and Quicke, D.L.J.|title=History of Insects|year=2002|publisher=[[Kluwer Academic Publishers]]|isbn=1-4020-0026-X}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

The remarkably successful [[Hymenoptera]]ns appeared as long as 146 million years ago in the [[Cretaceous]] era, but achieved their wide diversity more recently in the [[Cenozoic]] era, which began 66 million years ago.

Many modern insect [[genera]] developed during the Cenozoic. Insects from this period on are often found preserved in [[amber]], often in perfect condition.

Supraordinal relationships have undergone numerous changes with the advent of methods based on evolutionary history and genetic data. A recent theory is that Hexapoda is [[polyphyletic]], or where the last common ancestor was not a member of the group, with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from Insecta.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | title=Classification of Insect | author=David A.

The following list represents the best supported monophyletic groupings for the Insecta. 

Insects can be divided into two groups historically treated as subclasses: wingless insects, known as Apterygota, and winged insects, known as Pterygota. The Apterygota consist of two primitively wingless orders: bristletails (Archaeognatha) and silverfish (Thysanura). Archaeognatha make up the Monocondylia based on the shape of their [[mandible]]s, while Thysanura and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia. It is possible that the Thysanura themselves are not [[monophyletic]], with the family [[Lepidotrichidae]] a [[sister group]] to the Dicondylia (Pterygota and the remaining Thysanura).<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Classification of Insects&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book|last=Gilliott | first=Cedric | title=Entomology | publisher=Springer-Verlag New York, LLC | date=August 1995 | edition=2 | pages=820pp | isbn=0306449676 | url=http://books.google.com/?id=DrTKxvZq_IcC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=Insect+classification+based+on+winged+and+wingless#v=onepage&amp;q=Insect%20classification%20based%20on%20winged%20and%20wingless}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book| last=Kapoor | first=V.C.

Paleoptera and Neoptera are the winged orders of insects separated by the presence of hardened body parts called [[sclerite]]s; also, in Neoptera, muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen. Neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis-based ([[Polyneoptera]] and [[Paraneoptera]]) and complete metamorphosis-based groups. It has been proven hard to make clear of the relationships between the orders in Polyneoptera because of the constant new findings, and changing of the taxa based on them. For example, Paraneoptera has turned out to be more closely related to Endopterygota than to the rest of the Exopterygota. The recent molecular finding that the traditional louse orders [[Mallophaga]] and [[Anoplura]] are derived from within [[Psocoptera]] has led to the new taxon [[Psocodea]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Johnson, K.

It is likely that Exopterygota is paraphyletic in regards to Endopterygota.

The study of the classification or taxonomy of any insect is called [[Entomology|systematic entomology]]. Normally, if one chooses to work with a more specific order or even a family, the systematics would be added to the study of that order or family, an example would be [[Dipterology|systematic dipterology]].

Many insects are considered [[pest (animal)|pests]] by humans. Insects commonly regarded as pests include those that are parasitic ([[mosquito]]es, [[lice]], [[bed bug]]s), transmit diseases (mosquitoes, [[fly|flie]]s), damage structures ([[termite]]s), or destroy agricultural goods ([[locust]]s, [[weevil]]s). Many [[entomologist]]s are involved in various forms of pest control, as in research for companies to produce [[insecticides]], but increasingly relying on methods of [[biological pest control]], or biocontrol. Biocontrol uses one organism to reduce the population density of another organism — the pest — and is considered a key element of [[integrated pest management]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal | title=Biological control and sustainable food production | last1=Bale | first1=JS | last2=van Lenteren | first=JC | last3=Bigler | first2=F | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Despite the large amount of effort focused at controlling insects, human attempts to kill pests with insecticides can backfire. If used carelessly the poison can kill all kinds of organisms in the area, including insects' natural predators such as birds, mice, and other insectivores.

Although pest insects attract the most attention, many insects are beneficial to the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] and to [[human]]s. Some insects, like [[wasp]]s, [[bee]]s, [[butterfly|butterflie]]s, and [[ant]]s, [[pollination|pollinate]] [[flowering plant]]s. Pollination is a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship between plants and insects. As insects gather [[nectar]] from different plants of the same species, they also spread [[pollen]] from plants on which they have previously fed. This greatly increases plants' ability to [[cross-pollinate]], which maintains and possibly even improves their evolutionary [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. This ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops is critical to [[agriculture]]. A serious environmental problem is the [[pollinator decline|decline of populations of pollinator]] insects, and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for [[pollination management]] in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field, [[orchard]] or [[greenhouse]] at [[flowering plant|bloom]] time.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;The 1991 Yearbook of Agriculture&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Deborah T|title=Agriculture and the Environment: The 1991 Yearbook of Agriculture|publisher=United States Government Printing|date=December 1991|edition=1991|pages=191 pp.|isbn=0160341442|url=http://books.google.com/?id=fDTbAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=insects+pollinate&amp;dq=insects+pollinate}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><template><title>Rp</title><part><name index="1"/><value>240–243</value></part></template>
Insects also produce useful substances such as [[honey]], [[wax]], [[lacquer]] and [[silk]]. [[Honey bee]]s have been cultured by humans for thousands of years for honey, although contracting for crop pollination is becoming more significant for [[beekeeper]]s. The [[silkworm]] has greatly affected human history, as [[Silk Road|silk-driven trade]] established relationships between China and the rest of the world. 

[[Image:Drosophila melanogaster - side (aka).jpg| thumb | right | The common fruitfly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' is one of the most widely used organisms in biological research.]]
Insects play important roles in biological research. For example, because of its small size, short generation time and high [[fecundity]], the common fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' is a [[model organism]] for studies in the [[genetics]] of higher [[eukaryote]]s. ''D. melanogaster'' has been an essential part of studies into principles like [[genetic linkage]], [[epistasis|interactions between genes]], [[chromosome|chromosomal]] genetics, [[evo-devo|development]], behavior, and [[evolution]].

[[Insectivore|Insectivorous]] insects, or insects which feed on other insects, are beneficial to humans because they eat insects that could cause damage to agriculture and human structures. For example, [[aphid]]s feed on crops and cause problems for farmers, but [[ladybug]]s feed on aphids, and can be used as a means to get significantly reduce pest aphid populations. While [[bird]]s are perhaps more visible predators of insects, insects themselves account for the vast majority of insect consumption.

The [[Australian Dung Beetle Project]] successfully introduced 23 species of dung beetle, including ''Onthophagus gazella'' and ''Euoniticellus intermedius'' from [[South Africa]] and [[Europe]].

Scarab beetles held religious and cultural symbolism in [[Old Egypt]], [[Greece]] and some shamanistic Old World cultures.

In [[Mesopotamia]]n literature, the epic poem of [[Gilgamesh]] has allusions to [[Odonata]] which signify the impossibility of immortality.
Amongst the [[Indigenous Australians|Aborigines]] of [[Australia]] of the Arrarrente language groups, honey ants and witchety grubs served as personal clan totems. In the case of the 'San' bush-men of the [[Kalahari]], it is the [[praying mantis]] which holds much cultural significance including creation and zen-like patience in waiting.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gullan and Cranston&quot; </attr></ext><template><title>Rp</title><part><name index="1"/><value>9</value></part></template>
