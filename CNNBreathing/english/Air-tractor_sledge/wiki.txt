[[File:Air-tractor1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|alt=|The air-tractor sledge in 1912]]
The '''air-tractor sledge''' was a converted [[fixed-wing aircraft]] taken on the 1911–14 [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]], the first plane to be taken to the [[Antarctic]].<ref name="Bickel p. 39">Bickel (2000), p. 39</ref> Expedition leader [[Douglas Mawson]] had planned to use the [[Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane]] as a reconnaissance and [[search and rescue]] tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in [[Adelaide]], Australia, only two months before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer [[Frank Bickerton]] spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a [[sledge]], fashioning brakes from a pair of geological drills and a steering system from the plane's [[landing gear]]. It was first tested on 15&nbsp;November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.

Towing a train of four sledges, the air-tractor accompanied a party led by Bickerton to explore the area to the west of the expedition's base at [[Cape Denison]]. The freezing conditions resulted in the jamming of the engine's pistons after just {{convert|10|mi}}, and the air-tractor was left behind. Some time later it was dragged back to Cape Denison, and its frame was left on the ice when the expedition returned home in 1913. In 2008 a team from the [[Mawson's Huts|Mawson's Huts Foundation]] began searching for the remains of the air-tractor sledge; a seat was found in 2009, and parts of the tail a year later. The foundation believes that the air-tractor is still at Cape Denison, buried beneath the ice.

== Background ==
[[Douglas Mawson]] had accompanied [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s 1907–09 [[Nimrod Expedition|British Antarctic Expedition]]. Along with [[Edgeworth David]] and [[Alistair Mackay]], he had been part of a [[Manhauling|man-hauled]] sledging expedition, the first to reach the area of the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. Upon his return from Antarctica, he recommenced to his post as geology lecturer at the [[University of Adelaide]].<ref name="ADB">{{cite web

=== Purchase ===
Mawson travelled to Britain in early 1911 to raise funds, hire crew, and purchase equipment.<ref name="Riffenburgh p. 41">Riffenburgh (2009), p. 41</ref> He considered taking a [[aeroplane|plane]] to the Antarctic, which could work as a reconnaissance tool, transport cargo, and assist with search and rescue. Crucially, as no plane had yet been taken to the continent, it could also be used to generate publicity.<ref name="Riffenburgh p. 45">Riffenburgh (2009), p. 45</ref> Unsure of the type of plane he should take, but considering a [[Blériot Aéronautique|Blériot]], Mawson mentioned his plans to Scott's wife [[Kathleen Scott]], an aircraft enthusiast. She recommended he take a [[monoplane]], and conveyed his interest to Lieutenant [[Hugh Evelyn Watkins]] of the [[Essex Regiment]]. Watkins had connections with the ship and aircraft manufacturer [[Vickers Limited]], which had recently entered into a licence agreement to build and sell aircraft in Britain designed by the Frenchman [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]].<ref name="Ayres p. 49">Ayres (1999), p. 49</ref><ref name="Burke p. 210">Burke (1994), p. 210</ref> In a letter to Mawson on 18 May, Kathleen wrote:

[[File:Mawson's plane 2.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|The plane in testing, before being shipped to Australia]]

{{quote|I believe I can help you about aeroplanes. I think you can do far better than a Bleriot ... There is a machine that the Vickers people have bought which is infinitely more stable, heavier and more solid and will carry more weight. Its cost is £1000, but I think it could be worked to get it for £700 or even less ... A man I know who had only before driven biplanes, drove it and it stayed up half an hour, which speaks very well for its stability ... If you think it's worth considering, I can let you meet the man concerned early next week and he can show you the machine and take you up in it.<ref name="Ayres pp. 49-50">Ayres (1999), pp. 49–50</ref>}}

On Kathleen's advice, Mawson purchased a [[Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane]], one of only eight built.{{#tag:ref|Bethany Robinson (2004) suggests the British aviator [[Claude Grahame White]] may also have assisted Mawson with the choice of the Vickers.<ref name="Robinson p. 71">Robinson (2004), p. 71</ref> Each of the eight monoplanes was designated a number. As the second monoplane built, Vickers assigned Mawson's plane the designation "No.&nbsp;2".

The pilot used a [[joystick]] for pitch and roll, with lateral control by [[wing warping]].

=== Crash ===
A series of public demonstrations were planned in Australia to assist in fund-raising, the first of which was scheduled for 5 October at the [[Cheltenham Park Racecourse|Cheltenham Racecourse]] in Adelaide.<ref name="Riffenburgh p. 49">Riffenburgh (2009), p. 49</ref> During a test flight the day before, excessive pressure in the [[fuel tank]] caused it to rupture, almost blinding Watkins. That problem resolved, Watkins took [[Frank Wild]], whom Mawson had hired to command a support base during the expedition, on another test flight the morning of the demonstration.<ref name="Ayres pp. 55-56">Ayres (1999), pp. 55–56</ref> In Watkins' account, which he addressed to Vickers' Aviation Department, he wrote: "[we were] about 200 ft. up. I got into a fierce tremor, and then into an air pocket, and was brought down about 100 ft., got straight, and dropped into another, almost a vacuum. That finished it. We hit the ground with an awful crash, both wings damaged, one cylinder broken, and the Nose bent up, the tail in half, etc."<ref name="Ayres pp. 55-56"/>

[[File:Plane crash (air-tractor).jpg|thumb|left|alt=|The wreckage of the plane after it crashed at the Cheltenham Racecourse in Adelaide]]

Although the two men were only slightly injured, the plane was damaged beyond repair. Mawson decided to salvage the plane by converting it into a motorised [[sledge]]. He fitted the skis, and removed the wings and most of the sheathing to save weight.<ref name="Robinson p. 71"/> In his official account of the expedition, ''The Home of the Blizzard'', Mawson wrote that the advantages of this "air-tractor sledge" were expected to be "speed, steering control, and comparative safety from [[crevasse]]s owing to the great length of the runners".<ref name="Mawson p. 243">Mawson (1996), p. 243</ref> No longer needing a pilot, and believing him to be responsible for the crash, Mawson dismissed Watkins.<ref name="Ayres p. 56">Ayres (1999), p. 56</ref><ref name="Riffenburgh p. 50">Riffenburgh (2009), p. 50</ref>

The air-tractor sledge was taken to Hobart, where the expedition ship [[SY Aurora|SY ''Aurora'']] was being loaded. It was secured on board in a crate lined with [[tin]], which weighed far more than the sledge itself, on top of the ship's [[forecastle]] and two boat-skids.<ref name="Mawson p. 11">Mawson (1996), p. 11</ref><ref name="Riffenburgh p. 56">Riffenburgh (2009), p. 56</ref> To fuel the sledge, along with the [[Launch (boat)|motor launch]] and the [[wireless]] equipment, the ''Aurora'' also carried {{convert|4000|impgal|L}} of [[benzine]] and {{convert|1300|impgal|L}} of [[kerosene]].<ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 55-56">Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 55–56</ref> Fully loaded, the ship left Hobart on 2 December 1911.<ref name="Mawson p. 13">Mawson (1996), p. 13</ref>

The ''Aurora'' reached the Antarctic mainland on 8 January 1912, after a two-week stop on [[Macquarie Island]] to establish a wireless relay station and research base.<ref name="Riffenburgh p. 59">Riffenburgh (2009), p. 59</ref> The expedition's main base was established in [[Adélie Land]], at [[Cape Denison]] in [[Commonwealth Bay]].{{#tag:ref|During the voyage south, Mawson consolidated the planned third base into his own main base; the remaining [[Western Base party]], under Wild, was established on the [[Shackleton Ice Shelf]].<ref name="Riffenburgh p. 62">Riffenburgh (2009), p. 62</ref> The expedition party at Cape Denison later discovered their base was situated at one of the windiest places on earth;<ref name="Ayres p. 49">Ayres (1999), p. 49</ref> Mawson later wrote that he was "quite sure that anybody who had been out in [the wind] for a few minutes would gladly exchange for hell."<ref name="Riffenburgh p. 86">Riffenburgh (2009), p. 86</ref>|group="nb"}}<ref name="Riffenburgh p. 62"/> While the ''Aurora'' was unloading, a violent [[Whirlwind (atmospheric phenomenon)|whirlwind]] lifted the {{convert|300|lb|adj=on}} lid off the air-tractor's crate, throwing it {{convert|50|yd}}.

Bickerton began work on the air-tractor sledge on 14 April.<ref name="Riffenburgh p. 80">Riffenburgh (2009), p. 80</ref> His first job was to repair the sledge, which had been damaged in transit when a violent storm hit the ''Aurora''.

He constructed brakes from a pair of geological drills, and a steering system from the landing gear.

[[File:Air-tractor in motion.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|The air-tractor sledge in motion]]

On 27 October, Mawson outlined the summer sledging program. Seven sledging parties would depart from Cape Denison, surveying the coast and interior of Adélie Land and neighbouring [[King George V Land]]. They were required to return to the base by 15 January, when the ''Aurora'' was due to depart; any later, it was feared, and she would be trapped by ice. Bickerton was to lead one of the parties, which would use the air-tractor to haul four sledges and explore the coast to the west of the hut. Most of the parties left in early November, but Bickerton's Western party delayed until December, in the hope of avoiding the ferocious winter winds.<ref name="Riffenburgh pp. 98-99">Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 98–99</ref> Work on the air-tractor sledge was delayed by the fierce winds, and the first trial took place on 15 November, between the main base and Aladdin's Cave—a depot which had been established on the plateau above Cape Denison.<ref name="Robinson p. 72"/> The air-tractor reached a speed of {{convert|20|mph}}, covering the {{convert|5|mi}}, expedition member [[Charles Francis Laseron|Charles Laseron]] recorded, "in great style".<ref name="Robinson p. 72"/><ref name="Burke pp. 210-211">Burke (1994), pp. 210–211</ref> Soon, the sledge began hauling cargo up the slope, laying depots for the summer sledging parties.<ref name="Robinson p. 72"/><ref name="Henderson p. 30">Henderson (2010), p. 30</ref>

=== Broken ===
The Western party left Cape Denison on 3 December 1912.<ref name="Burke p. 211">Burke (1994), p. 211</ref> Accompanying Bickerton and the air-tractor were cartographer [[Alfred Hodgeman]] and surgeon [[Leslie Whetter]].<ref name="Riffenburgh p. 99">Riffenburgh (2009), p. 99</ref> The air-tractor made slow progress hauling its train of sledges, and about {{convert|10|mi}} out from the base its engine began experiencing difficulty.<ref name="Burke p. 211"/> Bickerton shut it down and the three set up camp. At 4&nbsp;am the next morning the party set off again,<ref name="Mawson p. 243"/> but the engine continued to struggle; oil ejected from an idle cylinder and the cylinder's lack of compression led Bickerton to suspect broken [[piston ring]]s to be the root of the problem. This would take only a matter of hours to fix. As he later recorded, "These thoughts were brought to a sudden close by the engine, without any warning, pulling up with such a jerk that the propeller was smashed. On moving the latter, something fell into the oil in the crank-case and fizzled, while the propeller could only be swung through an angle of about 30&nbsp;[degrees]."<ref name="Henderson pp. 30-31">Henderson (2010), pp. 30–31</ref>

The party continued without the air-tractor, man-hauling the sledges to a point {{convert|158|mi}} west of Cape Denison, and returned to base on 18 January.<ref name="Mawson p. 246">Mawson (1996), p. 246</ref><ref name="Riffenburgh p. 149">Riffenburgh (2009), p. 149</ref> Mawson's [[Far Eastern Party]] failed to return, and six men, including Bickerton, remained for an extra winter. On 8 February, just hours after ''Aurora'' left Commonwealth Bay after waiting for three weeks, Mawson staggered alone into base, his colleagues [[Belgrave Edward Sutton Ninnis]] and [[Xavier Mertz]] dead.{{#tag:ref|The party had used [[sledge dog]]s to explore the land beyond the [[Mertz Glacier|Mertz]] and [[Ninnis Glacier]]s to the east of Cape Denison. {{convert|310|mi}} from base, Ninnis and the sledge he was walking beside were lost when they broke through the lid of a crevasse. Their supplies severely compromised, Mawson and Mertz struggled back west, using the remaining sledge dogs to supplement their scarce rations. About {{convert|100|mi}} from Cape Denison, Mertz succumbed to the combined effects of starvation and food poisoning; the dogs' livers contained dangerously high levels of [[vitamin A]].<ref name="ADB"/> Mawson pushed on alone, and reached base in very poor health; much of the skin on his lower body had peeled off, his hair was falling out, and he was experiencing digestive problems.<ref name="Riffenburgh p. 154">Riffenburgh (2009), p. 154</ref> The ''Aurora'' had arrived in Commonwealth Bay on 13 January 1913 and waited for the sledging parties to return. However, her master, [[John King Davis]], was concerned about the encroaching ice, and left for Wild's party on 8 February.<ref name="Ayres pp. 86-87">Ayres (1999), pp. 86–87</ref>|group="nb"}}<ref name="Riffenburgh p. 145">Riffenburgh (2009), p. 145</ref><ref name="Riffenburgh p. 151">Riffenburgh (2009), p. 151</ref> As Mawson was being nursed back to health, Bickerton dragged the air-tractor sledge back to base to diagnose the reason for its failure.

When ''Aurora'' returned to Cape Denison for the final time on 13&nbsp;December 1913, only the engine and propeller were taken back to Australia.<ref name="Henderson p. 31">Henderson (2010), p. 31</ref><ref name="Riffenburgh p. 171">Riffenburgh (2009), p. 171</ref>

[[File:Air-tractor 1931.jpg|thumb|right|alt=|The frame of the air-tractor in 1931]]
The bill for the plane remained unpaid. In 1914 Vickers reminded Mawson, who had apparently forgotten, of the outstanding debt. Mawson wrote to Vickers director [[Trevor Dawson|Sir Trevor Dawson]] in November 1916, requesting the company write off the bill as a donation. His company buoyed by armaments contracts, Dawson agreed.<ref name="Ayres p. 119">Ayres (1999), p. 119</ref> The next expedition to take a plane to the Antarctic was Shackleton's 1921–22 [[Shackleton–Rowett Expedition|''Quest'' Expedition]], but the [[Avro Baby]] remained grounded owing to missing parts.<ref name="Fisher and Fisher, p. 452">Fisher and Fisher (1957), p. 452</ref> Not until 16&nbsp;November 1928—when [[Hubert Wilkins]] and [[Carl Ben Eielson]] flew for 20&nbsp;minutes around [[Deception Island]], just over a year before Admiral [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]]'s first flight over the South Pole—was a plane airborne in the Antarctic.<ref name="Burke p. 34">Burke (1994), p. 34</ref><ref name="Burke pp. 60-63">Burke (1994), pp. 60–63</ref>

The frame of the air-tractor sledge remained on the ice at Boat Harbour where Bickerton had left it. The last expedition to Cape Denison to see the frame was in 1976; the next expedition, in 1981, could find no trace of it. In 2008 a team from the [[Mawson's Huts|Mawson's Huts Foundation]] began to search for the remnants of the plane. Temperature records from the nearby [[Dumont d'Urville Station]] showed that there had been extended periods (each of about six weeks) of above average temperatures in 1976 and 1981, suggesting the ice around the harbour could have melted.<ref name="Henderson p. 31"/> Chris Henderson, the leader of the team, believes "the frame sank in situ to the rock surface, three metres below the present ice surface".<ref name="Henderson p. 31"/> Over the following three summers, the team extensively surveyed the area where they believed the air-tractor to be, using [[ground-penetrating radar]], [[differential GPS]], [[bathymetry]] equipment, and ice [[auger]]s.<ref name="Henderson pp. 31-32">Henderson (2010), pp. 31–32</ref> The ice showed signs of a recent melt, and sat on rock level with the harbour bottom.<ref name="Henderson p. 32">Henderson (2010), p. 32</ref>

In January 2009 the remains of a seat from the air-tractor were found in rocks near the hut, about {{convert|200|m}} from where the team believes the frame to be buried.<ref name="Henderson p. 32"/><ref name="ABC 21/1/2009">{{cite web
