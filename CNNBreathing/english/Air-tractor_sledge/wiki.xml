The '''air-tractor sledge''' was a converted [[fixed-wing aircraft]] taken on the 1911–14 [[Australasian Antarctic Expedition]], the first plane to be taken to the [[Antarctic]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Bickel p. 39&quot;</attr><inner>Bickel (2000), p. 39</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Expedition leader [[Douglas Mawson]] had planned to use the [[Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane]] as a reconnaissance and [[search and rescue]] tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in [[Adelaide]], Australia, only two months before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer [[Frank Bickerton]] spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a [[sledge]], fashioning brakes from a pair of geological drills and a steering system from the plane's [[landing gear]]. It was first tested on 15&amp;nbsp;November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.

Towing a train of four sledges, the air-tractor accompanied a party led by Bickerton to explore the area to the west of the expedition's base at [[Cape Denison]]. The freezing conditions resulted in the jamming of the engine's pistons after just <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>10</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>mi</value></part></template>, and the air-tractor was left behind. Some time later it was dragged back to Cape Denison, and its frame was left on the ice when the expedition returned home in 1913. In 2008 a team from the [[Mawson's Huts|Mawson's Huts Foundation]] began searching for the remains of the air-tractor sledge; a seat was found in 2009, and parts of the tail a year later. The foundation believes that the air-tractor is still at Cape Denison, buried beneath the ice.

<h level="2" i="1">== Background ==</h>
[[Douglas Mawson]] had accompanied [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s 1907–09 [[Nimrod Expedition|British Antarctic Expedition]]. Along with [[Edgeworth David]] and [[Alistair Mackay]], he had been part of a [[Manhauling|man-hauled]] sledging expedition, the first to reach the area of the [[South Magnetic Pole]]. Upon his return from Antarctica, he recommenced to his post as geology lecturer at the [[University of Adelaide]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;ADB&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web

Watkins had connections with the ship and aircraft manufacturer [[Vickers Limited]], which had recently entered into a licence agreement to build and sell aircraft in Britain designed by the Frenchman [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Ayres p. 49&quot;</attr><inner>Ayres (1999), p. 49</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Burke p. 210&quot;</attr><inner>Burke (1994), p. 210</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> In a letter to Mawson on 18 May, Kathleen wrote:

Although the two men were only slightly injured, the plane was damaged beyond repair. Mawson decided to salvage the plane by converting it into a motorised [[sledge]].

On 27 October, Mawson outlined the summer sledging program. Seven sledging parties would depart from Cape Denison, surveying the coast and interior of Adélie Land and neighbouring [[King George V Land]]. They were required to return to the base by 15 January, when the ''Aurora'' was due to depart; any later, it was feared, and she would be trapped by ice. Bickerton was to lead one of the parties, which would use the air-tractor to haul four sledges and explore the coast to the west of the hut. Most of the parties left in early November, but Bickerton's Western party delayed until December, in the hope of avoiding the ferocious winter winds.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Riffenburgh pp. 98-99&quot;</attr><inner>Riffenburgh (2009), pp. 98–99</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Work on the air-tractor sledge was delayed by the fierce winds, and the first trial took place on 15 November, between the main base and Aladdin's Cave—a depot which had been established on the plateau above Cape Denison.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Robinson p. 72&quot;</attr></ext> The air-tractor reached a speed of <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>20</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>mph</value></part></template>, covering the <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>5</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>mi</value></part></template>, expedition member [[Charles Francis Laseron|Charles Laseron]] recorded, &quot;in great style&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Robinson p. 72&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Burke pp. 210-211&quot;</attr><inner>Burke (1994), pp. 210–211</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Soon, the sledge began hauling cargo up the slope, laying depots for the summer sledging parties.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Robinson p. 72&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Henderson p. 30&quot;</attr><inner>Henderson (2010), p. 30</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

The bill for the plane remained unpaid. In 1914 Vickers reminded Mawson, who had apparently forgotten, of the outstanding debt. Mawson wrote to Vickers director [[Trevor Dawson|Sir Trevor Dawson]] in November 1916, requesting the company write off the bill as a donation. His company buoyed by armaments contracts, Dawson agreed.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Ayres p. 119&quot;</attr><inner>Ayres (1999), p. 119</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The next expedition to take a plane to the Antarctic was Shackleton's 1921–22 [[Shackleton–Rowett Expedition|''Quest'' Expedition]], but the [[Avro Baby]] remained grounded owing to missing parts.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Fisher and Fisher, p. 452&quot;</attr><inner>Fisher and Fisher (1957), p. 452</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Not until 16&amp;nbsp;November 1928—when [[Hubert Wilkins]] and [[Carl Ben Eielson]] flew for 20&amp;nbsp;minutes around [[Deception Island]], just over a year before Admiral [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]]'s first flight over the South Pole—was a plane airborne in the Antarctic.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Burke p. 34&quot;</attr><inner>Burke (1994), p. 34</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Burke pp. 60-63&quot;</attr><inner>Burke (1994), pp. 60–63</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

The frame of the air-tractor sledge remained on the ice at Boat Harbour where Bickerton had left it. The last expedition to Cape Denison to see the frame was in 1976; the next expedition, in 1981, could find no trace of it. In 2008 a team from the [[Mawson's Huts|Mawson's Huts Foundation]] began to search for the remnants of the plane. Temperature records from the nearby [[Dumont d'Urville Station]] showed that there had been extended periods (each of about six weeks) of above average temperatures in 1976 and 1981, suggesting the ice around the harbour could have melted.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Henderson p. 31&quot;</attr></ext> Chris Henderson, the leader of the team, believes &quot;the frame sank in situ to the rock surface, three metres below the present ice surface&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Henderson p. 31&quot;</attr></ext> Over the following three summers, the team extensively surveyed the area where they believed the air-tractor to be, using [[ground-penetrating radar]], [[differential GPS]], [[bathymetry]] equipment, and ice [[auger]]s.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Henderson pp. 31-32&quot;</attr><inner>Henderson (2010), pp. 31–32</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The ice showed signs of a recent melt, and sat on rock level with the harbour bottom.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Henderson p. 32&quot;</attr><inner>Henderson (2010), p. 32</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

In January 2009 the remains of a seat from the air-tractor were found in rocks near the hut, about <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>200</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>m</value></part></template> from where the team believes the frame to be buried.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Henderson p. 32&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;ABC 21/1/2009&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web

The tail had been removed from the rest of the air-tractor before it was abandoned in 1913, therefore its discovery did not shed much light on the location of the rest of the frame, but according to Henderson it shows that &quot;the frame, or parts of it, can survive for nearly 100&amp;nbsp;years in this environment&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Henderson p. 32&quot;</attr></ext> The team had hoped to return to Cape Denison over the 2010–11 summer, but the crash of a French helicopter near Dumont d'Urville Station in October 2010 forced a postponement.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;ABC 5/1/2011&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web
