'''Bartholomew "Barry" Allen''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[superhero]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]] and the second '''[[Flash (comics)|Flash]]'''. The character [[first appeared]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #4 (Oct. 1956), created by writers [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Bob Kanigher]] and [[penciler]] [[Carmine Infantino]].

==Fictional character biography==
Barry Allen is a police scientist (his job title was changed to a [[forensic scientist]] in the [[Iron Heights]] one-shot) with a reputation for being very slow, deliberate, and frequently late, which frustrates his fiancee, [[Iris West Allen|Iris West]]. One night, as he is preparing to leave work, a lightning bolt shatters a case full of chemicals and spills them all over Allen. As a result, Allen finds that he can run extremely fast and has matching reflexes. He dons a set of red tights sporting a lightning bolt, dubs himself the Flash (after his childhood hero in the comic books, [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]), and becomes a crimefighter of [[Central City (DC Comics)|Central City]]. In his civilian identity, he stores the costume in his ring, which can eject the compressed clothing when Allen needs it and suck it back in with the aid of a special gas that shrinks the suit.  In addition, Allen invented the [[cosmic treadmill]], a device that allowed for precise [[time-travel]] and was used in many stories. Allen was so well liked that nearly all speedsters that come after him are constantly compared to him. [[Batman]] once said "Barry is the kind of man that I would've hoped to become if my parents hadn't been murdered".

===Justice League===
[[Image:Showcase4.JPG|thumb|left|175px|''Showcase'' #4 (Oct. 1956): First appearance of the Silver Age Flash.  Art by [[Carmine Infantino]] and [[Joe Kubert]].]]

As presented in ''Justice League of America'' #9, when the Earth is infiltrated by [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] warriors sent to conquer the planet, some of the world's greatest heroes join forces -- Allen is one of them. While the superheroes individually defeat most of the invaders, they fall prey to a single alien and only by working together are they able to defeat the warrior. Afterwards the heroes decide to found the [[Justice League of America]].

During the years, he is depicted as feeling attracted to [[Black Canary]] and [[Zatanna]], but he never pursues a relationship because he feels his real love is Iris West. Allen also becomes good friends with [[Hal Jordan|Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)]], which would later be the subject of the limited series ''Flash and Green Lantern: The Brave and the Bold''.

In ''Flash'' # 123 &ndash; "[[Flash of Two Worlds]]," &ndash; Allen is transported to [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Catalogued Earths|Earth-Two]] where he meets [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], the original Flash in DC Continuity; it is revealed that Jay Garrick's adventures were captured in comic book form on [[Earth-One]].  This storyline initiated DC's multiverse and was continued in issues of ''Flash'' and in team-ups between the [[Justice League of America]] of [[Earth-One]] and the [[Justice Society of America]] of [[Multiverse (DC Comics)#Catalogued Earths|Earth-Two]]. In the classic story from ''Flash'' # 179 &ndash; "The Flash - Fact or Fiction?" &ndash; Allen is thrown into the universe eventually called [[Earth Prime]], a representation of "our" universe, where he seeks the aid of the ''Flash'' comic book's editor [[Julius Schwartz]] to build a [[cosmic treadmill]] so that he can return home.

===Tragedy===
In time, he married his girlfriend Iris, who learned of his double identity because Allen talked in his sleep. She kept his secret, and eventually, he revealed his identity to her of his own free will. Iris was eventually revealed to have been sent as a child from the 30th century and adopted.

In the 1980s, Flash's life begins to collapse. Iris is murdered by [[Professor Zoom]] (who had long loved her and been jealous of Allen), and when Allen prepares to marry another woman, Zoom tries the same trick again. Allen stops him, killing Zoom in the process by breaking his neck. Unfortunately, due to Barry being unable to make an appearance at his own wedding, his fiancé eventually descends into madness.

Put on trial for Zoom's murder, Allen is eventually acquitted, and learns that Iris's spirit has in fact been taken to the 30th century, where she is given a new body.

===''Crisis on Infinite Earths''===
{{main|Crisis on Infinite Earths}}
Following the trial, Allen retires and joins Iris in the 30th century. However, after only a few weeks of happiness, the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' intervenes, and Allen is captured by the [[Anti-Monitor]] and brought to 1986; according to the Anti-Monitor, the Flash was the only being capable of travelling to other universes at will, so the Anti-Monitor couldn't allow him to stay free. Allen escapes and foils the Anti-Monitor's plan to destroy the Earth, but dies in the process. It has been said that Allen travels back through time and becomes the very same lightning bolt that gives him his powers, but later it is also strongly implied that the soul of Barry resides in the [[Speed Force]], the mystical source and Valhalla open to all dead speedsters, and from which the living ones draw their amazing powers. After Allen's death, [[Wally West]], his nephew and sidekick (known as ''Kid Flash''), takes up the mantle of the Flash.

====After death====
[[Marv Wolfman]], scribe for the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', has repeatedly stated (first hinted at in his introduction to the original ''Crisis'' collected edition hardcover), then fully explained on his website [http://www.marvwolfman.com/Q&A.html]) that he left a loophole in the script wherein the Barry Allen Flash could be re-introduced, without a retcon necessary, into DC Universe continuity. This loophole would have featured Barry being pulled out of time at some period during his desperate run to annihilate the anti-matter cannon, but, knowing that he would someday have to return to the time loop, he would become ever more determined to use his speed to help others, cramming everything that he could into the little time he had left before he would have to return and die to ensure the stability of the timeline.

It should also be noted that the way Barry Allen seemed to have "died" in ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', was that he ran so fast that he was able to stop the Anti-Monitor’s anti-matter cannon from firing by catching the tachyon beam at the heart of the weapon.  After this act, according to ''Secret Origins Annual'' #2 (1988), Barry Allen turns into a lightning bolt, goes back in time, becoming the lightning bolt that hit his lab, splashing his past-self with chemicals and transforming him into the Flash. [http://www.hyperborea.org/flash/wheres-barry.html] 

In ''Deadman: Dead Again'', Barry is one of the heroes whose spirit Deadman helps to enter Heaven, and the ''[[Green Arrow]]'' storyline "Quiver" depicts Barry Allen in Heaven. His spirit, however, seems to still be alive within the speed force, along with Max and the rest of the speedsters.

===Legacy===
Iris is pregnant when Allen dies, and she has two children, the [[Tornado Twins]], who later meet the [[Legion of Super-Heroes]]. Each of her children themselves have children. One, Jenni Ognats, grows up to become the Legionnaire [[XS (comics)|XS]], while the other, [[Bart Allen]], is born with a rapid-aging illness, and is sent back to the 20th century where he is cured by Wally West. He remains there as the superhero Impulse, later becoming the second Kid Flash as a member of the [[Teen Titans]]. [[One Year Later|One year]] after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Bart becomes the fourth Flash until he is abruptly killed by [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] and [[Rogues (comics)|the Rogues]] in ''The Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #13. Wally then retook the identity of The Flash.

===Post-Crisis appearances===
Due to his time-travel abilities, even death does not stop Barry from aiding his friends and family. 

Barry first reappears during the ''Chain Lightning'' arc, where Flashes from different eras join together to defeat [[Cobalt Blue]].  Previously, a man that was thought to be Barry Allen, was revealed to be a past version of [[Professor Zoom]], the Reverse Flash, who had been driven mad on a visit to the past and believed himself to be Barry Allen.  Cobalt Blue is Barry Allen's twin brother, who had been given to another couple at birth due to a mistake at the hospital.  The resulting battle takes place shortly before Barry Allen is kidnapped during the Crisis on Infinite Earths.  Barry is nearly killed in this battle, almost rewriting the outcome of the Crisis.

When Wally West, wracked by grief for the loss of his unborn twins at the hands of [[Zoom (comics)|Zoom]], regrets the public knowledge of his identity, Barry comes from somewhere in time, counseling him, and talking the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] into granting his wish.  He then disappears, telling his nephew that he will come to his aid three times, the three most difficult days of his life.  In fact, when Zoom enlists the aid of [[Professor Zoom]] to make Wally relive the loss of his beloved twins, Barry is already there, trying to stop his own [[Reverse Flash]].  For the second time, he helps Wally to undo the damage dealt by Zoom, also allowing Wally to save his twins, and then he returns to his proper timeline.

====Infinite Crisis====
{{main|Infinite Crisis}}

In the fourth issue of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'', Barry Allen comes out from the Speed Force, along with [[Johnny Quick]] and [[Max Mercury]], to help his grandson Bart to deal with [[Superboy Prime]], taking the villainous lad with him in the Speed Force. [[Bart Allen]] appears wearing Barry Allen's costume in Tokyo near the end of ''Infinite Crisis'' #5 to tell the heroes that Superboy Prime has escaped the Speed Force. Bart again reappears in ''Infinite Crisis'' #7 in Barry Allen's costume to combat Superboy Prime once more.
In ''Flash: The Fastest Man Alive'' #6 (2006) (taken place shortly before ''Infinite Crisis #5'') is told how Barry spent four years in an alternate Keystone City along with Max Mercury, Johnny Quick and an alternate Jay Garrick, until he met Bart and Wally West, joining him after the battle against Superboy-Prime. After Superboy escapes, Barry suggests that someone has to absorb the whole Speed Force and cross the dimensional bridge back to Post-Crisis Earth. As Bart volunteers, Barry gives him his suit as a last gift, to keep the Force contained, and stays behind. Wally West didn't go because of his wife and kids. Bart says he knows Barry would go if he could, but why Barry Allen could not make the journey himself is not stated.

 <!-- And it should be in a pub history, not a fictional bio... -->

==Powers and abilities==

Barry Allen was believed to be the fastest of all known Flashes, capable of running at the speed of light with little difficulty.  In ''Flash'' #150, "straining every muscle," he ran at ten times the speed of light. However, when he pushed himself further (during the Crisis on Infinite Earths) he appeared to waste away as he was converted into pure energy, travelled back in time, and was revealed to be the very bolt of lightning that gave him his powers. Barry Allen possessed abilities that Jay Garrick and Wally West have not always been able to duplicate, most notably the ability to "vibrate" in such a way as to pass through solid matter.  Allen regularly engaged in time travel using the Cosmic Treadmill device.

==Rogues gallery==
{{main|Rogues (comics)}}
The Flash acquired a colorful rogues gallery of villains.  These criminals typically had unusually modest goals for their power level (robbery or other petty crimes), and each adopted a specific theme in his or her equipment and methods.

* ''Ballad of Barry Allen'' - A song by the band [[Jim's Big Ego]] on their album, "They're Everywhere".

* In the movie ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', Frank Abagnale, Jr. ([[Leonardo DiCaprio]]) uses the name Barry Allen from The Flash comic book as one of his aliases in the film.
