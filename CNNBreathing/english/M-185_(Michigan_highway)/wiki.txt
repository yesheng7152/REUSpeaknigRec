'''M-185''' is a [[Michigan Highway System|state trunkline highway]] in the U.S. state of [[Michigan]] that circles [[Mackinac Island]], a popular tourist destination on the [[Lake Huron]] side of the [[Straits of Mackinac]], along the island's shoreline. A narrow paved road of {{convert|8.004|mi|km}}, it offers scenic views of the straits that divide the [[Upper peninsula of Michigan|Upper]] and the [[Lower peninsula of Michigan|Lower]] peninsulas of Michigan and Lakes Huron and [[Lake Michigan|Michigan]]. It has no connection to any other Michigan state trunkline highways—as it is on an island—and is accessible only by passenger ferry. The [[Mackinac Island, Michigan|City of Mackinac Island]], which shares jurisdiction over the island with the [[Mackinac Island State Park Commission]] (MISPC), calls the highway '''Main Street''' within the built-up area on the island's southeast quadrant, and '''Lake Shore Road''' elsewhere. M-185 passes by several key sites within [[Mackinac Island State Park]], including [[Fort Mackinac]], [[Arch Rock (Mackinac Island)|Arch Rock]], [[British Landing]], and [[Devil's Kitchen (cave)|Devil's Kitchen]]. Lake Shore Road carries the highway next to the Lake Huron shoreline, running between the water's edge and woodlands outside of the downtown area.

According to the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]] (MDOT), M-185 is "the only state highway in the nation where motor vehicles are banned".<ref name=MDOTFacts>{{cite web |publisher= Michigan Department of Transportation |url= http://michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9620_11154-129683--,00.html |title= Road & Highway Facts |work= History and Culture |date= November 3, 2005 |author= Staff |accessdate= March 17, 2008}}</ref> Traffic on it is by foot, on horse, by horse-drawn vehicle, or by bicycle.  Restrictions on automobiles date back to the 1890s, and since the ban, only a few vehicles have been permitted on the island other than the city's emergency vehicles. The highway was built during the first decade of the 20th century by the state and designated as a state highway in 1933. The highway was paved in the 1950s, and portions were rebuilt to deal with shoreline erosion in the 1980s. Until 2005, it was the only state highway without any automobile accidents.

Mackinac Island has been a tourist destination since the late 19th century.  The island was the country's [[Mackinac National Park|second national park]], after [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], until the land was given to Michigan in 1895 to become its first state park.<ref name=miller95/> M-185 has been recognized in the press for its unique role as the only state highway without car traffic in the United States by such publications as ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'',<ref name=shade>{{cite news |title=Yes, the Water Does Go all the Way Around Mackinac Island You're Welcome To Visit, but Leave the Silly Questions Behind |first= Joanne Prim |last= Shade |work= [[The Kansas City Star]] |date= August 30, 1992 |page= I3 |issn= 0745-1067}}</ref> the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'',<ref name=habes>{{cite news |first= Bob |last= Habes |title= Mac Attack: 13 Crowd-Beating Ways To Tackle a Special Island |work= [[Chicago Tribune]] |date= August 15, 1993 |at= Travel section, p.&nbsp;1 |issn= 1085-6706}}</ref> the ''[[Toronto Star]]'',<ref name=hanes>{{cite news |last= Hanes |first= Tracy |title= Mackinac a Pedestrian's Haven |url= http://www.thestar.com/article/505311 |work= [[Toronto Star]] |date= September 27, 2008 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/639W4FON3 |archivedate= November 12, 2011 |accessdate= November 8, 2011 |deadurl= no |issn= 0319-0781}}</ref> and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.<ref name=miller95>{{cite journal |last= Miller |first= Holly G. |date= September 1995 |title= Michigan's Crown Jewel |url= http://www.questia.com/read/1P3-6768863/michigan-s-crown-jewel |journal= [[The Saturday Evening Post]] |volume= 267 |issue= 5 |issn= 0048-9239 |pages= 74+ |accessdate= September 21, 2012 |subscription= yes |via= Questia}}</ref> In 2003, it was named the "best scenic drive" in the state by ''[[The Detroit News]]''.<ref name=recreation>{{cite news |author=Staff |title= Michigan's Best: Recreation |work= [[The Detroit News]] |date= April 16, 2003 |pages=28M+ |issn= 1055-2715 }}</ref> In 2008, ''[[USA Today]]'' named the island one of the "10 great places to get your feet back on the ground" as a car-free destination, highlighting the unique status of M-185 in the process.<ref name=baruffi>{{cite news |last= Baruffi |first= Kathy |title= 10 Great Places To Get Your Feet Back on the Ground |work= [[USA Today]] |date=  June 20, 2008 |page= 8D |issn= 0734-7456}}</ref> The magazine ''Paraplegia News'', in an article encouraging its readers to visit Mackinac Island, called the trek around the island on M-185 a "high priority" for visitors.<ref name=lichon>{{cite journal |title= A Timeless Getaway: Don't Just Imagine What Mackinac Island Is Like—It's Waiting for You To Visit! |first= Jeff |last= Lichon |journal= Paraplegia News |volume= 61 |issue= 5 |date= May 2007 |page= 20 |issn= 0031-1766 |location= Phoenix, AZ |publisher= [[Paralyzed Veterans of America]]}}</ref> The trip around the island "provides a photo opportunity at every bend in the path", according to the ''PSA Journal'', the official magazine of the [[Photographic Society of America]].<ref name=vannoy>{{cite journal |title= Bring a Camera To Experience the 19th Century on Mackinac Island |first= Dana |last= Vannoy |journal= PSA Journal |volume= 69 |issue= 5 |date= May 2003 |page= 30 |location= Oklahoma City , OK |publisher= [[Photographic Society of America]] |issn= 0030-8277}}</ref>

===Along the harbor===
[[Image:m185mackinac.jpg|thumb|right|Bikers on M-185 at mile marker&nbsp;0 in downtown Mackinac Island|alt=Photo of ]]
The beginning and ending of M-185 is marked at the intersection of Main and Fort streets next to the visitor center.<ref name=map/> That building is operated by the MISPC, but it was originally a US Coast Guard station.<ref name=hutchins/> From its starting point, M-185 heads east between [[Marquette Park (Mackinac Island)|Marquette Park]], at the base of Fort Mackinac, and the marina at Haldimand Bay. The roadway passes the [[Indian Dormitory]] (Mackinac Art Center), as well as various hotels, bed and breakfast establishments, private residences and landmarks such as Sainte Anne's Catholic Church, [[Mission Church]] and the [[Mission House (Mackinac Island)|Mission House]]. Main Street then turns northeasterly, passing Mission Point Resort (the former [[Mackinac College]]), after which the road name changes to Lake Shore Road. Along this section of the trunkline, Shoreline Trail departs to the south and follows the water's edge before returning to M-185 at the city's water filtration plant.<ref name=map/><ref name=hutchins/><ref name=martone>{{cite book |last= Martone |first= Laura |title= Michigan's Traverse Bays and Mackinac Island |series= Moon Spotlight |edition= 2nd |location= Berkeley, CA |publisher= Avalon Travel |year= 2010 |pages= 61–7 |isbn= 978-1-59880-923-7}}</ref>

===Around the island===
After rounding Mission Point, M-185 continues north-northwesterly along the eastern shore of Mackinac Island, first passing Dwightwood Spring then the [[Arch Rock (Mackinac Island)|Arch Rock]] viewing area just beyond the mile&nbsp;1 marker. The next two miles (3.2&nbsp;km) of M-185 are relatively isolated and devoid of major landmarks as the highway rounds Hennepin Point and runs along Voyageur's Bay. Other than a few picnic tables, the only feature between Arch Rock and mile&nbsp;3 is the Lake Shore Nature Trail, a short interpretive trail on the inland side of the road. Just beyond mile&nbsp;3, Scott's Shore Road, a short gravel-surfaced connecting roadway between Lake Shore Road and Scott's Road, departs inland near Point St. Clair. M-185 is bounded by the interior woods on one side and the beaches and rocky shores on the other through this area.<ref name=map/><ref name=hutchins/><ref name=martone/>

[[File:M-185 Biking near Mile Marker1.jpg|thumb|left|Looking south near mile&nbsp;1|alt=A photo]]
Mile&nbsp;4 is situated at Point aux Pins at the northernmost point of the island. Here, M-185 turns southerly, passing the state boat dock and a nature center before coming to [[British Landing]] at the intersection with British Landing Road. The area is a popular stopping point for tourists biking or walking M-185; it is the location where British troops came ashore during the [[Battle of Mackinac Island (1812)|Battle of Mackinac Island]] during the [[War of 1812]]. Located around British Landing  are various amenities including restrooms, picnic tables, and a concession stand. M-185 continues along Maniboajo Bay and passes the mile&nbsp;5 marker near Radisson Point.<ref name=map/><ref name=hutchins/><ref name=martone/>

The next area along M-185 is also sparsely developed as it passes along Griffin Cove. Other than a few newer residential developments, the sights are limited to Brown's Brook, which features a picnic area and interpretive nature trail, and the views of the [[Mackinac Bridge]] as the trunkline rounds both Heriot and Perrot points. Between the markers for miles&nbsp;6 and 7 is the [[Devil's Kitchen (cave)|Devil's Kitchen]], another popular tourist stopping point, at Jacker Point. Near mile&nbsp;7 is the West Bluff Stairs leading up the bluff to Pontiac's Lookout. Further along, there is a marker commemorating the filming of a scene from ''[[Somewhere in Time (film)|Somewhere in Time]]'' as well as  views of the [[Grand Hotel (Mackinac Island)|Grand Hotel]].<ref name=map/> The building's {{convert|660|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} front porch<ref name=grand>{{cite news |title= Grand Hotel Turns 125 This Week |work= [[The Mining Journal]] |location= Marquette, MI |agency= [[Associated Press]] |page= A5 |date= July 9, 2012 |issn= 0898-4964 }}</ref> is promoted as the "longest in the world".<ref name=weeks>{{cite news |first= George |last= Weeks |url= http://apps.detnews.com/apps/history/index.php?id=212 |title= Mackinac Island's Grand Hotel Is History's Front Porch |work= [[The Detroit News]] |date= September 18, 2003 |accessdate= November 9, 2011 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/634rOVtbj |archivedate= November 9, 2011 |deadurl= no |page= 1D |issn= 1055-2715}}</ref> Visible to the east of the hotel is [[Michigan Governor's Mansion#Summer residence|Michigan's second Governor's Mansion]], which is used as a summer retreat for the state's chief executive. At this point, M-185 transitions back to the more developed portion of the island and the road name for the trunkline changes back to Main Street. Next to the roadway, a boardwalk runs  from here into the downtown business district.<ref name=map/><ref name=hutchins/><ref name=martone/>

===Entering downtown===
[[File:M-185 Downtown Mackinac Island Michigan.jpg|thumb|Downtown Mackinac Island near the Star Line Ferry Dock and the Lake View Hotel|alt=Photo of]]
The first landmark as the highway approaches downtown Mackinac Island is the island's [[Mackinac Island Public School|public school building]]. As it passes the island's public library on the shoreline side of the street, Main Street makes a sweeping curve to the north at Windermere, or Biddle's, Point to run through the downtown district. Other than the library, most of the city's public buildings are actually situated along Market Street, one block behind Main Street. Three streets and a city park allow for connections between Main and Market streets. M-185 through downtown Mackinac Island passes through the major business district, featuring dozens of shops, restaurants and lodging establishments; nearly a dozen of these outlets, feature the authentic Mackinac Island fudge made fresh daily during tourist season. The passenger ferry docks are all situated along Main Street in the downtown area.  At the northeastern end of the downtown district, Main Street intersects Fort Street at the state park visitor center to complete its circuit of Mackinac Island.<ref name=map/><ref name=hutchins/><ref name=martone/>

==History==
The first city ordinances banning all motorized vehicles from the island were passed on July 6, 1898, with similar state park rules coming in 1901.<ref name=MHM>{{cite web |author= Mackinac Island State Park Commission |url= http://www.hal.state.mi.us/mhc/autoshow/vehicles/mackauto.html |title= Early Automobiles on Mackinac Island |work= A Michigan Auto Tour |publisher= Michigan Historical Museum |year= 1999 |accessdate= November 7, 2011 |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/63CFF8t45 |archivedate= November 14, 2011 |deadurl= no}}</ref> The residents complained after a doctor's car scared their horses and caused carriage accidents, and these complaints prompted the ban.<ref name=hunts>{{cite book |last1= Hunt |first1= Mary |last2= Hunt |first2= Don |chapter= Mackinac Island |chapterurl= http://hunts-upguide.com/mackinac_island.html |title= Hunts' Guide to Michigan's Upper Peninsula |url= http://hunts-upguide.com/ |year= 2007 |location= Albion, MI |publisher= Midwestern Guides |accessdate= November 8, 2011 |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref> As such, other than a handful of emergency and utility vehicles as well as others by special, limited-time permit, no cars or trucks are allowed on the island and no motorized vehicles appear on M-185.

[[File:Mackinac Island July 2010 13 (Arch Rock).JPG|thumb|left|A view of M-185 through Arch Rock|alt=Photo showing]]
In the mid-1980s, rising water levels in Lake Huron endangered M-185 and bicyclists. The roadway was overwashed by waves from the lake during a storm on May 31, 1985; the waves littered the road with gravel and dirt and raised fears of erosion. MDOT spent around $50,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US-NGDPPC|50000|1985|r=-3}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-NGDPPC}}{{inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC|lastauthoramp=yes}}) to install {{convert|2500|ST|LT t|-2|lk=on}} of rock and filter cloth designed to prevent erosion. The expectation at the time was that Lake Huron could rise another {{convert|4|-|5|in|cm}} that summer. Such a lake level increase prompted worries that the waves would wash away sections of the road. The lake had already washed away shoreline near Arch Rock; there was at least {{convert|8|ft|m}} of berm between the road and shoreline in the 1970s and by 1985 some sections had been reduced to just {{convert|2|in|cm}}.<ref name=sobota1985-06-15>{{cite news |last= Sobota |first= Michele |title= State Rescues Island Shore Road Endangered by Rising Lake Levels |work= Mackinac Island Town Crier |date= June 15, 1985 |issn= 8750-040X}}</ref> Storms later that year washed away sections of M-185, removing huge chunks of asphalt. MDOT closed those stretches  on July 7, 1986, after the [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] weekend, to fix the damage. Repairs were budgeted to replace the missing sections of roadway at a cost of $894,366 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US-NGDPPC|894366|1986|r=1}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-NGDPPC}}{{inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC|lastauthoramp=yes}}); tourists were detoured inland, and uphill, to access the island's various tourist attractions.<ref name=kerwin1986-06-26>{{cite news |last= Kerwin |first= James L. |title= Mackinac Island Isn't Immune to Road Repair Woes |work= The Detroit News |date= June 26, 1986 |issn= 1055-2715}}</ref>

In 1979, while filming ''Somewhere in Time'', a car was brought on the island for [[Christopher Reeve]]'s character to drive. The next time that a vehicle was permitted on the island was on July 6, 1998, to commemorate the original ordinance that prohibited cars from Mackinac Island. A 1901 [[Geneva (automobile company)|Geneva]] steam-powered car toured the island and was exhibited in Marquette Park before being towed by horse back to British Landing.<ref name=MHM/>

MDOT obtained a $242,000 grant (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US-NGDPPC|242000|1986|r=-3}}}} in {{inflation-year|US-NGDPPC}}{{inflation-fn|US-NGDPPC|lastauthoramp=yes}}) from the [[Federal Highway Administration]] in 2002 to purchase conservation easements along M-185. The land adjacent to the highway on the east side of the island is publicly owned while along the west it is mostly private. The grant allowed the MISPC and MDOT to either purchase the development rights to adjacent properties along Lake Shore Road, or the adjacent properties themselves.<ref name=McManus>{{cite news |last= McManus |first= Shawna |date= June 25, 2002 |title= Mackinac Island Gets Road Money: State Grant Will Allow Land Buys and Construction of Scenic Drives |work= [[Cheboygan Daily Tribune]] |page= A1 |issn= 0746-665X}}</ref>

The only known motor vehicle collision on Mackinac Island occurred on M-185 at the head of the Shepler passenger ferry dock on May 13, 2005, when the island's fire truck slightly damaged the door on the island's ambulance; both vehicles were responding to a report from the ferryboat that an injured passenger required medical attention.<ref name=mac-accident>{{cite news |url= http://www.mackinacislandnews.com/news/2005/0520/News/043.html |title= Cause of Ferry Injuries Under Investigation |date= May 20, 2005 |work= Mackinac Island Town Crier |accessdate= September 5, 2008 |author= Staff |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5z7RzgxhO |archivedate= June 1, 2011 |deadurl= no |issn= 8750-040X}}</ref> Before this incident, it was the only state highway that "never had an automobile accident" according to the ''[[Toronto Star]]''.<ref name=star>{{cite news |last=Marsh |first = Betsa |title=Horsing Around on Mackinac Island |work= Toronto Star |date=June 3, 2000 |page=L18 |issn= 0319-0781}}</ref>
