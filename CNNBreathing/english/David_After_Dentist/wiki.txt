'''David After Dentist''' is an [[internet phenomenon]] which started when David DeVore Jr.'s father posted a video on the internet of his reaction to [[anaesthesia]] after he had been given [[oral surgery]]. As of late December 2009, the video has been seen over 42 million times on [[YouTube]] alone. 

== Video origins and publication ==
In May 2008, 7-year old David DeVore Jr. was taken to the dentist to have an extra tooth removed, due to a hereditary condition called [[Hyperdontia]]. Because this was David's first surgery and his mother couldn't be there, his father decided to video tape the experience to share with her and their family.

After the surgery, David was feeling extra loopy from the [[anaesthesia]] he was given.  While in the car, he was asking his father questions like "Is this real life?" and "Is this going to last forever?" and also telling him that he had four fingers.

Seven months later, David's father uploaded the video on [[Facebook]]. Being overwhelmed with people wanting to see the video, he decided to upload it to [[YouTube]], but didn't notice there was a private option.  Just 3 days after the upload, it had been seen over 3 million times.  As of November 15, 2009, the video has been viewed on YouTube 34,563,298 times.
 
The DeVore family were soon made YouTube Partners. This gives YouTube the right to run ads over the videos they post, and in exchange, are given a share of the revenue.  They also sell "David After Dentist" t-shirts and donate a portion of the revenue they earn to dental [[charities]].<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txqiwrbYGrs David After Dentist Video]</ref><ref>[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/29892601/?gt1=43001 David on the ''Today'' show]</ref><ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/08/bill-oreilly-goes-after-f_n_212635.html David Sr. on Bill O'Reilly]</ref><ref>[http://www.davidafterdentist.com The Story of David After Dentist]</ref> <ref>[http://www.rocketboom.com/know-your-meme-david-after-dentist/ Know Your Meme: David After Dentist]</ref>
