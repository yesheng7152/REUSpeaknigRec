All data is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike
4.0 International license (CC-BY-SA 4.0).

The original authors of each article can be found under
https://{de,en,nl}.wikipedia.org/wiki/[name of the article]

The speaker of each audio file can be found in the meta data (see below)

The corpora are structured as follows: Each article has a separate
directory with the name urlencoded to prevent problems with special
characters.  Each directory contains:

 - aligned.swc
     the time-aligned text (see below for the schema)
 - audiometa.txt
     the meta data for the spoken version, taken from wikimedia
	 commons.  Unaltered semi-structured Mediawiki markup.
 - audio.ogg
     the audio file. Sometimes there are several numbered files if the
	 original recording was split.  Timings in the alignment are
	 always wrt. the complete recording.
 - info.json
     meta data about this article, also found in the aligned.swc header.
	 Only distributed for convenience.
 - wiki.{html,txt,xml}
     the original version of the article in different formats straight
	 from the wikipedia API.

The text (i.e. everything that is not markup) of wiki.html is
identical to the text of aligned.swc character by character.  This is
a major feature of the annotation as it allows you to obtain the html
annotation for every swc-annotated part and vice versa.

The annotation schema used for aligned.swc is defined at
  http://nats.gitlab.io/swc/schema.rnc
and contains comments explaining the schema.
