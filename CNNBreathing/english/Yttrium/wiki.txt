'''Yttrium''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|ɪ|t|r|i|əm}} {{respell|IT|ree-əm}}) is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Y''' and [[atomic number]] 39. It is a silvery-metallic [[transition metal]] chemically similar to the [[lanthanide]]s and it has often been classified as a "[[rare earth element]]".<ref name="IUPAC" /> Yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in [[rare earth mineral]]s and is never found in nature as a free element. Its only stable [[isotope]], <sup>89</sup>Y, is also its only naturally occurring isotope.

In 1787, [[Carl Axel Arrhenius]] found a new mineral near [[Ytterby]] in Sweden and named it ''[[gadolinite|ytterbite]]'', after the village. [[Johan Gadolin]] discovered yttrium's oxide in Arrhenius' sample in 1789,<ref name="Krogt" /> and [[Anders Gustaf Ekeberg]] named the new oxide ''[[yttria]]''. Elemental yttrium was first isolated in 1828 by [[Friedrich Wöhler]].<ref name="CRC2008" />

The most important use of yttrium is in making [[phosphor]]s, such as the red ones used in television [[cathode ray tube]] displays and in [[LED]]s.<ref name="Cotton" /> Other uses include the production of [[electrode]]s, [[electrolyte]]s, [[electronic filters]], [[laser]]s and [[superconductor]]s; various medical applications; and as [[Trace element|traces]] in various materials to enhance their properties. Yttrium has no known biological role, and exposure to yttrium compounds can cause lung disease in humans.<ref name="osha" />

==Characteristics==
===Properties===
Yttrium is a soft, silver-metallic, lustrous and highly crystalline [[transition metal]] in [[group 3 element|group 3]]. As expected by [[periodic trend]]s, it is less [[electronegativity|electronegative]] than its predecessor in the group, [[scandium]], more electronegative than its successor in the group, [[lanthanum]], and less electronegative than the next member of [[period 5 element|period 5]], [[zirconium]].<ref name ="Greenwood1997p946" /><ref name="Hammond">{{cite book|url = http://www-d0.fnal.gov/hardware/cal/lvps_info/engineering/elements.pdf|title = The Elements|chapter=Yttrium|author = Hammond, C.

The pure element is relatively stable in air in bulk form, due to [[passivation]] resulting from the formation of a protective oxide ({{chem|Y|2|O|3}}) film on its surface. This film can reach a thickness of 10&nbsp;[[micrometre|µm]] when yttrium is heated to 750&nbsp;°[[Celsius|C]] in [[water vapor]].<ref name="ECE817" /> When finely divided, however, yttrium is very unstable in air; shavings or [[swarf|turnings]] of the metal can ignite in air at temperatures exceeding 400&nbsp;°C.<ref name="CRC2008" /> [[Yttrium nitride]] (YN) is formed when the metal is heated to 1000&nbsp;°C in [[nitrogen]].<ref name="ECE817" />

===Similarity to the lanthanides===
{{details|Rare earth element}}
The similarities of yttrium to the [[lanthanide]]s are so strong that the element has historically been grouped with them as a [[rare earth element]],<ref name="IUPAC">{{cite book|author = IUPAC contributors|title = Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry: IUPAC Recommendations 2005|editor = Edited by N G Connelly and T Damhus (with R M Hartshorn and A T Hutton)|pages = 51|year = 2005
|isbn = 0-85404-438-8|url = http://www.iupac.org/publications/books/rbook/Red_Book_2005.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-12-17|publisher = RSC Publishing}}</ref> and is always found in nature together with them in [[rare earth mineral]]s.<ref name="Emsley498">[[#Emsley2001|Emsley 2001]], p. 498</ref>

Chemically, yttrium resembles these elements more closely than its neighbor in the periodic table, [[scandium]],<ref name="ECE810">[[#Daane1968|Daane 1968]], p. 810</ref> and if its physical properties were plotted against [[atomic number]] then it would have an apparent number of 64.5 to 67.5, placing it between the lanthanides [[gadolinium]] and [[erbium]].<ref name="ECE815">[[#Daane1968|Daane 1968]], p. 815</ref>

It often also falls in the same range for reaction order,<ref name="ECE817" /> resembling [[terbium]] and [[dysprosium]] in its chemical reactivity.<ref name="Cotton" /> Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'Yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves as if it were one of them.<ref name="ECE817" /><ref name="Greenwood1997p945">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=945}}</ref> Even though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in atomic radius may be attributed to the [[lanthanide contraction]].<ref name="Greenwood1997p1234">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=1234}}</ref>

One of the few notable differences between the chemistry of yttrium and that of the lanthanides is that yttrium is almost exclusively [[valency (chemistry)|trivalent]], whereas about half of the lanthanides can have valences other than three.<ref name="ECE817">[[#Daane1968|Daane 1968]], p. 817</ref>

===Compounds and reactions===
{{category see also|Yttrium compounds}}
As a trivalent transition metal, yttrium forms various [[inorganic chemistry|inorganic compounds]], generally in the oxidation state of +3, by giving up all three of its [[valence electron]]s.<ref name="Greenwood1997p948">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=948}}</ref> A good example is [[yttrium(III) oxide]] ({{chem|Y|2|O|3}}), also known as yttria, a six-[[coordinate covalent bond|coordinate]] white solid.<ref name="Greenwood1997p947">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=947}}</ref>

Yttrium forms a water-insoluble [[fluoride]], [[hydroxide]], and [[oxalate]], but its [[bromide]], [[chloride]], [[iodide]], [[nitrate]] and [[sulfate]] are all [[solubility|soluble]] in water.<ref name="ECE817" /> The Y<sup>3+</sup> [[ion]] is colorless in solution because of the absence of electrons in the d and f [[electron shell]]s.<ref name="ECE817" />

[[Water]] readily reacts with yttrium and its compounds to form {{chem|Y|2|O|3}}.<ref name="Emsley498" /> Concentrated [[nitric acid|nitric]] and [[hydrofluoric acid]]s do not rapidly attack yttrium, but other strong acids do.<ref name="ECE817" />

With [[halogen]]s, yttrium forms [[halide|trihalides]] such as [[yttrium(III) fluoride]] ({{chem|YF|3}}), [[yttrium(III) chloride]] ({{chem|YCl|3}}), and [[yttrium(III) bromide]] ({{chem|YBr|3}}) at temperatures above roughly 200&nbsp;°C.<ref name="osha" /> Similarly, [[carbon]], [[phosphorus]], [[selenium]], [[silicon]] and [[sulfur]] all form [[binary compound]]s with yttrium at elevated temperatures.<ref name="ECE817" />

[[Hapticity]] is how a group of contiguous atoms of a [[ligand]] are coordinated to a central atom; it is indicated by the Greek character ''eta'', η.

===Nucleosynthesis and isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of yttrium}}
Yttrium in the [[Solar System]] was created through [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], mostly by the [[s-process]] (≈72%), but also by the [[r-process]] (≈28%).<ref name="Pack">{{cite journal|journal = Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|volume = 71|issue = 18|year = 2007|doi = 10.1016/j.gca.2007.07.010|title = Geo- and cosmochemistry of the twin elements yttrium and holmium|first = Andreas|last = Pack|coauthor = Sara S.

[[File:Mira 1997.jpg|thumb|alt=Grainy irregular shaped yellow spot with red rim on a black background|[[Mira]] is an example of the type of red giant star where most of the yttrium in the solar system was created.]]
Yttrium isotopes are among the most common products of the [[nuclear fission]] of uranium occurring in nuclear explosions and nuclear reactors. In terms of [[nuclear waste]] management, the most important isotopes of yttrium are <sup>91</sup>Y and <sup>90</sup>Y, with half-lives of 58.51&nbsp;days and 64&nbsp;hours, respectively.<ref name="NNDC" /> The first is formed directly from fission, while the latter, despite its short half-life, exists in [[secular equilibrium]] with its long-lived parent isotope, [[strontium-90]] (<sup>90</sup>Sr) with a half-life of 29&nbsp;years.<ref name="CRC2008" />

All group three elements have an odd [[atomic number]], and therefore they have few stable [[isotope]]s.<ref name ="Greenwood1997p946">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=946}}</ref> [[Scandium]] has one [[stable isotope]], and yttrium itself has only one stable isotope, <sup>89</sup>Y, which is also its only naturally occurring one. However, the [[rare earth elements|lanthanide rare earths]] contain elements of even atomic number and many stable isotopes. Yttrium-89 is thought to be more abundant than it otherwise would be, due in part to the s-process which allows enough time for isotopes created by other processes to decay by [[beta decay|electron emission]] (neutron → proton).<ref name="Greenwood1997p12-13" /><ref group=note>Essentially, a [[neutron]] becomes a [[proton]] while an [[electron]] and [[antineutrino]] are emitted.</ref> Such a slow process tends to favor isotopes with [[atomic mass number]]s (A = protons + neutrons) around 90, 138 and 208, which have unusually stable [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] with 50, 82, and 126 neutrons, respectively.<ref name="Greenwood1997p12-13" /><ref group=note>

In 1843, [[Carl Gustaf Mosander]] found that samples of yttria contained three oxides: white [[yttrium oxide]] (yttria), yellow [[terbium(III,IV) oxide|terbium oxide]] (confusingly, this was called 'erbia' at the time) and rose-colored [[erbium oxide]] (called 'terbia' at the time).<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie|volume=60

===Production===
The chemical similarity of yttrium with the lanthanides leads it to being enriched by the same processes and ends up in ores containing lanthanides, forming [[rare earth mineral]]s. A slight separation is recognized between the light (LREE) and the heavy rare earth elements (HREE) but this separation is never complete.

It is difficult to separate yttrium from other rare earths. One method to obtain pure yttrium from the mixed oxide ores is to dissolve the oxide in [[sulfuric acid]] and fractionate it by [[ion exchange]] [[chromatography]]. With the addition of [[oxalic acid]], the yttrium oxalate precipitates. The oxalate is converted into the oxide by heating under oxygen. By reacting the resulting yttrium oxide with [[hydrogen fluoride]], [[yttrium fluoride]] is obtained.<ref name="Holleman" />

Annual world production of yttrium oxide had reached 600&nbsp;[[tonne]]s by 2001, with reserves estimated at 9&nbsp;million&nbsp;tonnes.<ref name="Emsley497" /> Only a few tonnes of yttrium metal are produced each year by reducing [[Yttrium(III) fluoride|yttrium fluoride]] to a metal sponge with [[calcium]] [[magnesium]] alloy. The temperature of an [[arc furnace]] of above 1,600&nbsp;°C is sufficient to melt the yttrium.<ref name="Emsley497" /><ref name="Holleman">{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 1056–1057|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.

===Superconductors===
[[File:YBCO-modified.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Dark grey pills on a watchglass. One cubic piece of the same material on top of the pills.|[[YBCO]] superconductor]]
Yttrium was used in the [[yttrium barium copper oxide]] (YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, aka 'YBCO' or '1-2-3') [[superconductor]] developed at the [[University of Alabama]] and the [[University of Houston]] in 1987.<ref name="Wu" /> This superconductor operated at 93&nbsp;K, notable because this is above [[liquid nitrogen]]'s boiling point (77.1&nbsp;K).<ref name="Wu" /> As the price of liquid nitrogen is lower than that of [[liquid helium]], which has to be used for the metallic superconductors, the operating costs would decrease.

The actual superconducting material is often written as YBa<SUB>2</SUB>Cu<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUB>7–''d''</SUB>, where ''d'' must be less than 0.7 if the material is to be superconducting. The reason for this is still not clear, but it is known that the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes and chains, giving rise to a peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior.

The theory of low temperature superconductivity has been well understood since the so-called BCS theory was put forward in 1957. It is based on a peculiarity of the interaction between 2 electrons in a crystal lattice. However, BCS theory does not explain high temperature superconductivity, and its precise mechanism is still a mystery. What is known is that the composition of the copper-oxide materials has to be precisely controlled if superconductivity is to occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/rzepa/mim/century/html/ybco_text.htm |publisher=Imperial College|accessdate=2009-12-20|title=Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide – YBCO}}</ref> 

The created material was a black and green, multi-crystal, multi-phase mineral. Researchers are studying a class of materials known as [[perovskite]]s that are alternative mixtures of these elements, hoping to eventually develop a practical [[high-temperature superconductor]].<ref name="Stwertka116" />

==Precautions==
Water soluble compounds of yttrium are considered mildly toxic, while its insoluble compounds are non-toxic.<ref name="Emsley495" /> In experiments on animals, yttrium and its compounds caused lung and liver damage, though toxicity varies with different yttrium compounds. In rats, inhalation of yttrium citrate caused [[pulmonary edema]] and [[dyspnea]], while inhalation of [[yttrium chloride]] caused liver edema, [[pleural effusion]]s, and pulmonary hyperemia.<ref name="osha">{{cite web|author = OSHA contributors|url = http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/yttriumandcompounds/recognition.html|title = Occupational Safety and Health Guideline for Yttrium and Compounds|accessdate = 2008-08-03|publisher = United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration|date = 2007-01-11}} (public domain text)</ref>
