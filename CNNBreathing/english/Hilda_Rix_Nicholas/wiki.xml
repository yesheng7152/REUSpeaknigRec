'''Hilda Rix Nicholas''' (née Rix, later '''Hilda Rix Wright''', 1 September 1884&amp;nbsp;– 3 August 1961)<template><title>#tag:ref</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Though born Emily Hilda Rix, neither published sources nor family correspondence normally use her first given name. The ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'' lists her as Emily Hilda Nicholas,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=ADBRix</attr></ext> despite the fact that no other source used that combination of names, nor did the artist herself.</value></part><part><name>group</name><equals>=</equals><value>notes</value></part></template> was an Australian artist. Hilda Rix was born in the [[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] city of [[Ballarat]]. Her father was an education administrator and poet, her mother a musician and artist. She studied under leading member of the [[Heidelberg School]], [[Frederick McCubbin]], at the [[National Gallery of Victoria Art School]] from 1902 to 1905. Following the death of her father in 1907, Hilda Rix, her only sibling Elsie and her mother travelled to Europe where she undertook further study in London and then in Paris. Her teachers during the period included [[John Hassall (illustrator)|John Hassall]], [[Richard Emil Miller]] and [[Théophile Steinlen]].

After travelling to [[Tangiers]] in 1912,  Rix held several successful exhibitions of her work, with one drawing, ''Grande marche, Tanger'', purchased by the French government. She was one of the first Australians to paint [[Post-impressionism|post-impressionist]] landscapes, was made a member of the [[Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français]], and had works hung in the [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] first in 1911 and again in 1913. The family evacuated from France to England after the outbreak of [[World War I]]. A period of personal tragedy followed, as Rix's sister died in 1914, then her mother in 1915. In 1916 she met and married Major George Matson Nicholas, only to be widowed the next month when he was killed on the [[Western Front]].

Returning to Australia in 1918, Rix Nicholas once more took up professional painting, and held an exhibition of over a hundred works at Melbourne's [[Storey Hall|Guild Hall]]. Many sold, including ''In Picardy'', purchased by the [[National Gallery of Victoria]]. Following a period painting in rural locations in the early 1920s, Rix Nicholas returned to Europe. A 1925 exhibition in Paris led to the sale of her work ''In Australia'' to the [[Musée du Luxembourg]], followed by an extensive tour of her paintings around regional British art galleries. There followed representation in other exhibitions, including at the [[International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers]], and the [[Royal Academy of Arts]], both in London. Following the inclusion of several works in the 1926 [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]] Spring exhibition in Paris she was made an Associate of that organisation.

In 1926, Rix Nicholas returned to Australia, and in 1928 she married Edgar Wright, whom she had met during her travels in the early 1920s. The couple settled at [[Delegate, New South Wales]]; their only child, a son named Rix Wright, was born in 1930. Though she continued to paint significant works including ''The Summer House'' and ''The Fair Musterer'', Rix Nicholas, a staunch critic of modernism who was disdainful of the works of emerging major artists such as [[Russell Drysdale]] and [[William Dobell]], grew out of step with trends in Australian art. Her pictures remained didactic, portraying an Australian pastoral ideal, and reviews of her exhibitions grew more uneven. She held her last solo show in 1947. Rix Nicholas remained at Delegate until her death in 1961. Her works are held in most major Australian collections, including the [[Art Gallery of South Australia]], [[Australian War Memorial]], [[National Gallery of Australia]], National Gallery of Victoria, and the [[Queensland Art Gallery]].

<h level="2" i="1">==Early life==</h>
Henry Finch Rix and Elizabeth Sutton, each of whom had migrated to Australia as children with their families, met and married in Victoria in 1876. They had two daughters, Elsie Bertha, born in 1877, and Emily Hilda (known ubiquitously just as Hilda), born in [[Ballarat]] on 1 September 1884.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Blue</attr><inner>{{cite web|url=http://artsearch.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=231480|last=Rix Nicholas|first= Hilda| title=The Three Sisters, Blue Mountains|year=purchased 2013|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=12 December 2013}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>pp</name><equals>=</equals><value>3–4</value></part></template> The Rix children grew up in a gifted and energetic family.

Both Elsie and Hilda took some art lessons with a Mr Mather, before Hilda went on to study at the [[National Gallery of Victoria Art School]] from 1902 to 1905, where she was taught by a leading member of the [[Heidelberg School]], [[Frederick McCubbin]]. Her fellow students were mostly women and included [[Jessie Traill]], [[Norah Gurdon]], [[Ruth Sutherland]], [[Dora Wilson]], and [[Vida Lahey]].<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>6</value></part></template> Rix would subsequently be critical of McCubbin's approach to teaching, referring to his methods as &quot;vague persuasions&quot;. Nevertheless, the author of the only comprehensive biography of Rix, John Pigot, considered that McCubbin influenced her in several ways: he emphasised the creativity of individuals rather than imitating the style of any one school of painting; he modelled the importance of [[nationalism|nationalistic ideas]] and subjects that would become so prominent in her later painting; and his work emphasised the painting's subject over technical considerations.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>7</value></part></template>

Drawings undertaken by Rix while she was still a student were included in annual exhibitions at the Victorian Artists' Society and the Austral Salon. At the same time, she was working as a professional illustrator for textbooks and a periodical, the ''School Paper'', published by the Victorian Department of Education.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>7</value></part></template> In 1903, all of the Rix family women had works included in the Austral Salon's exhibition.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Hoorn</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>18</value></part></template>

One of Rix's early sketchbooks survives and pages from it were reproduced in the 2012 book, ''In Search of Beauty''. Although she described the works as her &quot;very earliest drawings when a child in Melbourne&quot;, the dated pages indicate they were created up until at least the age of twenty. They mostly portray women, and the settings and dress of her subjects reflect the relatively affluent and educated milieu of which the Rix family were part.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Johnson</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>37</value></part></template>

In this period, it was common for aspiring Australian artists to seek further training in Europe, particularly London and Paris. Henry Rix arranged to take his family there in conjunction with a trip he was making to study British education reforms, purchasing first-class tickets to travel in 1906.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Johnson</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>21</value></part></template><template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>8</value></part></template> But Henry, who had been overworked and ill, died suddenly, and for a time it appeared the trip might not happen. Denied a widow's pension (Henry had been 58: too young for his wife to be eligible), the family had to reorganise their affairs and work out if they could afford to get to Europe.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>7</value></part></template><template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>de Vries</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2011</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>127</value></part></template> Finally, by combining an inheritance, rental income from their home, and money raised through the sale of works by both mother and daughter, they were able to trade the first class tickets for second class berths, and they set sail for England early in 1907.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>de Vries</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2011</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>127</value></part></template><template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Johnson</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>12</value></part></template>

[[File:Tom Roberts - Smike Streeton age 24 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arthur Streeton, as painted by [[Tom Roberts]]. Rix followed his advice to study under many different teachers.]] 
Just before her departure from Australia, Rix was advised by the painter [[Arthur Streeton]] to study with many different masters, as a means of preserving her own originality. Her subsequent career reflected that advice.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Hoorn</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>21</value></part></template> One of her first teachers was [[John Hassall (illustrator)|John Hassall]], although he had initially protested that she was already a better drawer than himself.

Late in 1907, Rix moved to Paris. There she met with Australian artist [[Emanuel Phillips Fox]], went on sketching expeditions to the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]] where [[Ethel Carrick Fox]] also worked, and became a student at the Académie Delecluse, operated by academic painter Auguste Delecluse.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>de Vries</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2011</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>130</value></part></template><template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>12</value></part></template> The following year she was taught by American impressionist [[Richard Emil Miller]]. From him she acquired the use of a relatively bright colour palette, not always naturalistic, as well as his dextrous technique; she did not, however, follow his predilection for pretty compositions, favouring more direct and clear images.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>14</value></part></template> Continuing to acquire skills from a wide range of artists, she next studied at the [[Académie de la Grande Chaumière]], including with Swiss-born illustrator [[Théophile Steinlen]].<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>16</value></part></template> In the summers, Rix, together with her sister and mother, would travel.

He asked Rix's mother for approval to marry her daughter, and Mrs Rix agreed. A happy engagement turned sour, however, when Rix spent time at her fiancé's home, where she found her prospective husband dominated by his mother, who strongly disapproved of the match. Rix reluctantly broke off the engagement.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>18</value></part></template><template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>de Vries</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2011</value></part><part><name>pp</name><equals>=</equals><value>133–134</value></part></template>

Rix twice visited north Africa. She first joined American painter [[Henry Ossawa Tanner]], his wife and a Miss Simpson on a trip to Morocco in January 1912. They travelled via Spain, where Rix viewed the work of [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], whose compositions and palette she greatly admired.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Hoorn</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>62</value></part></template> The party's destination was Tangier, a place where many other artists had sought inspiration. [[Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant]] lived and painted there in the 1870s, while [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] and [[John Singer Sargent]] visited in the 1880s. [[Henri Matisse]] and Rix were in Tangier at the same time,<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Hoorn</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>pp</name><equals>=</equals><value>56, 63–64</value></part></template> during which both visited [[Tétouan]], about <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>60</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>km</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>mi</value></part></template> east of Tangier;<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Hoorn</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>pp</name><equals>=</equals><value>99–103</value></part></template> they also used the same model in their works.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Hoorn</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2008</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>45</value></part></template>

For about three months, Rix sketched and painted in Tangier, spending time in the open-air market place or ''[[souk|soko]]''. Her enthusiasm for the place was evident from her correspondence:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Picture me in this market-place – I spend nearly every day there for it fascinates me completely – have done 16 drawings and two oil things so far – Am feeling thoroughly at home now so am going to take out my big oil box – wanted to get used to people and things first – Oh how I do love it all!&amp;nbsp;...

Morocco had a similar effect on Rix as it did on many artists who visited. Paintings were created in high-keyed colours that captured the intense north African light, and most works focussed on the figures, dress and activity of the people, or the local architecture.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>26</value></part></template>
One interpretation of the perspective of Rix is that she was an [[orientalism|orientalist]], in the sense used by academic [[Edward Said]]. However, Hoorn argues that she and her sister were to a significant extent counter-orientalist: they focussed on the common nature of human experience rather than cultural expressions of difference<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Hoorn</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>193</value></part></template> and they sought to portray everyday life in Tangier as they found it, rather than presenting [[Essentialism|generalised views]] of the orient.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Hoorn</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>4</value></part></template> Her works also reflected the [[modernism|modernist]] interest in the empirical: in using the bright light of north Africa to help bring out the structures and shapes that made up visual impressions.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Hoorn</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>128</value></part></template> Stylistically, Rix's Moroccan paintings have been characterised as the &quot;most abstract, flat and post-impressionistic of her career&quot;.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Hoorn</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>191</value></part></template> Whether this reflected the influence of Matisse is not known – despite the concidences of their Tangier visits, it is not certain that they actually met.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Hoorn</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>pp</name><equals>=</equals><value>99–103</value></part></template> Rix was one of the first Australians to paint [[Post-Impressionism|post-impressionist]] landscapes, represented by works such as ''Men in the Market Place, Tangier'' (1914) and ''View of Tangier'' (1914), produced at the time of a second visit to the city.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Hoorn</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>9</value></part></template> Such works demonstrated the development of Rix's style at the time: loose brush strokes, a palette confined to a few low-keyed colours, and an emphasis on shadow and light, affecting both the overall impression made by the picture and the treatment of individual figures.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/the-orient-expressed-20121228-2byj8.html|title=The orient expressed|last=Hoorn|first=Jeanette|date=29 December 2012|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=25 June 2014}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>&lt;/blockquote/&gt;

The ''Herald's'' reviewer was at odds with prevailing sentiment.

<h level="2" i="4">==Disaster 1914–1918==</h>
The retreat to London marked the beginning of a tragic period. Rix's mother Elizabeth had been unwell, and deteriorated during the crossing from France to England. Elizabeth was transferred to hospital when they landed; though she partially recovered and was moved to a nursing home, at that same time her other daughter, Elsie, fell ill.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>27</value></part></template>

Rix shuttled back and forth between her two ailing family members until, on 2 September 1914, Elsie died. For three months Rix withheld the news from her mother, fearing it would harm her already fragile condition. Elizabeth survived the news, but as the war continued, Rix's artistic output dwindled almost to nothing. Then in March 1916, Elizabeth passed away.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>28</value></part></template> Rix was just over thirty years old, and all her immediate relatives were now dead. Recalling the experience, she later wrote: &quot;I could scarcely put one foot in front of the other and walked like an old thing&quot;.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>28</value></part></template>

Further misfortune lay in store. In France, an Australian officer, Major George Matson Nicholas, was posted to  Étaples. There he heard about the Australian woman artist who had had to leave her paintings behind when she and her family left abruptly for England. Nicholas sought out the works and admired them, and decided to contact the artist when next he was on leave. He met Rix in September 1916, and they were married on 7 October at St Saviour's, Warwick Avenue in London. After three days together, he returned to duty; she was widowed five weeks later on 14 November, when he was shot and killed during battle at [[Flers, Somme|Flers]], on the [[Western Front]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.daao.org.au/bio/hilda-rix-nicholas/biography/?|title=Hilda Rix Nicholas b. 1884 Ballarat, Victoria |last=Pigot|first=John|date=1995 (updated 2011)|work=Design and Art Australia Online|accessdate=20 March 2014}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>pp</name><equals>=</equals><value>28–29</value></part></template><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15699903 |title=Melbourne notes |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=NSW |date=20 December 1916 |accessdate=2 March 2014 |page=5}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Initially writing in her diary that she had lost the will to live, Rix Nicholas's grief eventually found its expression in three paintings, titled ''And Those Who Would Have Been Their Sons, They Gave Their Immortality'' (a phrase from a poem by [[Rupert Brooke]]), ''Desolation'' and ''Pro Humanitate''. The second of these paintings (which was destroyed in 1930), portrayed a gaunt and tearful woman shrouded in a black cloak, crouched staring at the viewer amidst a battlescarred landscape, featureless but for the crosses on distant graves.

In 1922, a competition was launched by the trustees of the Melbourne Public Library for a mural to commemorate the Great War. Rix Nicholas learned of the competition and quickly prepared and submitted an entry. Three judges, all respected Melbourne academic artists, submitted a report to the trustees, who met to consider the entries received. The trustees voted six to five to grant the commission to [[Harold Septimus Power]], despite the fact that he had not fulfilled the conditions of entry; they then withheld the judges' report from publication, decided not to exhibit any of the competition entries, and delayed awarding any prize. One newspaper reported that Rix Nicholas's entry had been one of the top three. Rix Nicholas was furious, as were some former soldiers who wrote letters to newspapers about the incident. Pigot suggests that gender was a factor: &quot;While Rix Nicholas's claim to be a war artist was legitimate, the fact that she was a woman meant that she was denied an equal place within the discourse&quot;.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>pp</name><equals>=</equals><value>39–41</value></part></template> Later that same year, the [[Australian War Memorial]] decided to purchase a work by Rix Nicholas portraying a French woman (titled ''A Mother of France'' (1914)), but not to acquire the other work offered, showing an Australian soldier (''A Man'' (1921)); according to Pigot, this reflected the gendered approach taken by institutions, which considered that subjects suitable for portrayal by artists were dependent upon their sex.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>pp</name><equals>=</equals><value> 41–42, Plates 6, 16</value></part></template>

Her paintings of war subjects were just one aspect of Rix Nicholas's developing commitment to nationalist ideals and the heroic representation of Australia.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>42</value></part></template> At the time of her 1919 exhibition, Rix Nicholas had commented that she wished &quot;to show the people [of Europe] what is possessed in a land of beauty where the colour scheme is so different, and which sent so many gallant men to the struggle for liberty&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=virile</attr></ext> In this respect she was following in the tradition of the Heidelberg School and writers such as [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Patterson]], who extolled the virtues of the bush and pioneer life.

&lt;blockquote&gt; For combination of grace, dramatic strength, and clearness in technique this picture would be difficult to surpass. There is nothing finicky about it; it tells its story with vivid directness. As a background to the figure Mrs. Rix Nicholas has set a piece of antique tapestry, so that the trees on either side lean in arch-wise over the head, the face and shoulders stand out clearly against an expanse of sky, and behind the body and limbs extends a countryside full of towers and rivers and trees. The quaint conventionality of this background accords exactly with the late eighteenth-century costume, all sprigged with roses and heliotrope; and the whole mass of detail harmonies [sic] perfectly with the type of the model's face. It is a cold, selfish face. The artist has brought out with revealing strokes an expression of vindictive malice which is for the moment resting there; and the hands, the fingers of one grasped tightly by the other, give a clear indication of nervous tension within. The treatment of flesh tones and the general arrangement, drawing attention gently but not too obtrusively to the columbines scattered on the polished floor—those are excellent.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16391358 |title=Mrs Rix Nicholas |newspaper=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=NSW |date=4 June 1927 |accessdate=22 March 2014 |page=16 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the end of 1926, Rix Nicholas and Dorothy Richmond together returned to Australia.

[[File:Hilda Rix Nicholas painting &quot;The Summer House&quot;.jpg|thumb|right|''The Summer House'', painted circa 1933, is one of Rix Nicholas's best known works, but the artist herself was ambivalent about it and never showed it publicly.]]
While Australian artists embraced modernism and addressed the city, Rix Nicholas focussed on representing a pastoral ideal. In France in the 1920s, Rix Nicholas had entertained [[Roy de Maistre]], one of the first Australians to experiment with [[abstractionism]], and enthusiastically asked him to share more about his 'colour-music theory';<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>50</value></part></template> however when modernism confronted Australian art in the 1920s and 1930s, Rix Nicholas sided against it.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>66</value></part></template>
There was in any case, as art historian Jeanette Hoorn wryly observed, &quot;no market for post-impressionist painting in outback New South Wales in the 1920s&quot;.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Hoorn</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>199</value></part></template> Rix Nicholas sought to build on her existing success and often focussed on portraits,<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Hoorn</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>199</value></part></template> while her approach to her subject matter became &quot;more and more didactic&quot;.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>62</value></part></template> Women were frequently portrayed, both as rural workers (as in ''The Fair Musterer'') and in domestic or family scenes (as in ''On The Hilltop'').

Rix Nicholas had a number of exhibitions with some further critical success. Nevertheless, she became out of step with both the public, who bought few works at her last solo exhibition in 1947, and with some critics, who either rejected her work or criticised its lack of novelty. One critic, Adrian Lawler, observed:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mrs Rix Nicholas is very gifted and she has her own individuality as an artist; but her personal outlook is not so much that of an artist with startling things to say&amp;nbsp;... as of a healthy fellow-Australian who loves the familiar beauty of our landscape and delights in representing it in all its splendour and virility.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Johnson</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2012</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>30</value></part></template>&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another, considering a 1936 exhibition at the David Jones Gallery in Sydney, found the quality of her work uneven, and while he considered some to be strong, others were criticised as &quot;nothing more than pretty and sentimental&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article27990434 |title=Oil paintings |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |location=NSW |date=15 June 1936 |accessdate=25 February 2014 |page=5}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Rix Nicholas's works remained didactic and insistent in their idealism about rural Australia, but following World War II, the country – and its art critics – had moved on.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>71</value></part></template> In 1945, ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' critic, lambasting Rix Nicholas's works as &quot;crude in colour and poster-ish in presentation&quot;, concluded: &quot;There is insufficient spiritual material to fill the canvases of Hilda Rix Nicholas&amp;nbsp;... The bravura, the boldness of these pictures is hardly in keeping with the actual knowledge displayed.

The antipathy between Rix Nicholas and prevailing trends in Australian art was mutual. She was appalled by the works of [[Russell Drysdale]] and [[William Dobell]], describing the figures in their paintings as &quot;more like victims of the German prison camps&quot; than representations of Australian people.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>67</value></part></template> It seemed that the critics did not share her opinion: Dobell and Drysdale had each just won the [[Wynne Prize]] in successive years,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Wynnelist&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/prizes/wynne/|title=Wynne Prize – Explore past winners and finalists|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|accessdate=16 February 2014}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> and both would soon represent their country at the [[Venice Biennale]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/projects/venice-biennale/past-representation|title=Past Representation|work=Projects -&gt; Venice Biennale|publisher=Australia Council for the Arts|accessdate=17 March 2014}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

A final trip to Europe took place in 1950. She set out to show her husband the sights of a Europe she knew well, and to find a teacher of sculpture for their son Rix. She was distressed by the standards of artistic practice she found, and instead discouraged Rix from any career in the arts at all.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name> pp</name><equals>=</equals><value>71–72</value></part></template>

Following her last solo exhibition, a letter from Rix Nicholas to her son expressed despair in her artistic career and summarised the professional fate of her final years:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Not doing anything creative is nearly killing me. The trouble is that there is no one near me who cares whether I ever do any more work or not&amp;nbsp;... I feel the artist in me is dying and the dying is an agony&amp;nbsp;... only one's self knows the craving and the best part in one is aching unsatisfied.<template><title>sfn</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Pigot</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>2000</value></part><part><name>p</name><equals>=</equals><value>71</value></part></template>&lt;/blockquote&gt;
