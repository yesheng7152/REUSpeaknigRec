'''''Habemus Papam''''' is the announcement given in [[Latin]] by the [[Protodeacon|senior Cardinal Deacon]] upon the [[Papal conclave|election]] of a new [[pope]].

The announcement is given from the central balcony of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. After the announcement, the new pope is presented to the people and he gives his first ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]'' blessing.

==Format==

The format for the announcement when a cardinal is elected Pope is:

<blockquote xml:lang="la" lang="la"><poem>
Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum:
Habemus Papam!
Eminentissimum ac reverendissimum Dominum,
Dominum [First Name],
Sanctæ Romanæ Ecclesiæ Cardinalem [Last Name],
Qui sibi nomen imposuit [Papal Name].
</poem></blockquote>

In English, it reads:

<blockquote><poem>
I announce to you a great joy:
We have a Pope!
The most eminent and most reverend Lord,
Lord [First Name],
Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church [Last Name],
Who takes to himself the name of [Papal Name].
</poem></blockquote>

In the most recent ''Habemus Papam'' announcement, given by Cardinal [[Jorge Medina Estévez]] on [[19 April]] [[2005]] upon the [[Papal conclave, 2005|election]] of [[Pope Benedict XVI]], the announcement was preceded by a greeting in several languages:

<blockquote><div>
<span xml:lang="it" lang="it">Fratelli e sorelle carissimi.</span> ([[Italian language|Italian]])

<span xml:lang="es" lang="es">Queridísimos hermanos y hermanas.</span> ([[Spanish language|Spanish]])

<span xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bien chers frères et sœurs.</span> ([[French language|French]])

<span xml:lang="de" lang="de">Liebe Brüder und Schwestern.</span> ([[German language|German]])

<span xml:lang="en" lang="en">Dear brothers and sisters.</span> ([[English language|English]])
</div></blockquote>

==Announcing the names of the new Pontiff==

In announcing the name of the newly-elected pontiff, the new pontiff's birth forename or first name is announced in Latin in the accusative case (e.g., ''Angelum Iosephum'', ''Ioannem Baptistam'', ''Albinum'', ''Carolum'', ''Iosephum''), but the new pontiff's surname or family name is given in the original form (e.g., ''Roncalli'', ''Montini'', ''Luciani'', ''Wojtyła'', ''Ratzinger'').  The new pope's [[regnal name]] is usually given in the genitive case in Latin (e.g., ''Ioannis vicesimi tertii'', ''Ioannis Pauli primi'' etc.), although it can also be declined in the accusative case in Latin (as was the case in 1963 when [[Pope Paul VI]]'s regnal name was announced as ''Paulum sextum'').
