'''George V''' (George Frederick Ernest Albert; 3 June 1865<template><title>spaced ndash</title></template>20 January 1936) was [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion|British Dominions]], and [[Emperor of India]], from 6 May 1910 until his death in 1936.

George was a  grandson of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] and the first cousin of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II of Russia]] and [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany]]. From 1877 to 1891, he served in the [[Royal Navy]]. On the death of Victoria in 1901, George's father became [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]], and George was made [[Prince of Wales]]. On his father's death in 1910, he succeeded as [[King-Emperor]] of the [[British Empire]]. He was the only Emperor of India to be present at his own [[Delhi Durbar]].

As a result of the [[First World War]] (1914–18), most other European empires fell while the British Empire expanded to its greatest effective extent. In 1917, George became the first monarch of the [[House of Windsor]], which he renamed from the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] as a result of anti-German public sentiment. His reign saw the rise of [[socialism]], [[communism]], [[fascism]], [[Irish republicanism]], and the [[Indian independence movement]], all of which radically changed the political landscape. The [[Parliament Act 1911]] established the supremacy of the elected [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] over the unelected [[House of Lords]]. In 1924 he appointed the first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] ministry and in 1931 the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] recognised the dominions of the Empire as separate, independent states within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. He was plagued by illness throughout much of his later reign and at his death was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Edward VIII]].

<h level="2" i="1">==Early life and education==</h>
George was born on 3 June 1865, in [[Marlborough House]], London, as the second son of the [[Prince of Wales|Prince]] and [[Princess of Wales]], [[Edward VII|Albert Edward]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]]. His father was the eldest son of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. His mother was the eldest daughter of [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX of Denmark]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel]]. As a son of the Prince of Wales, George was styled ''His Royal Highness Prince George of Wales'' at birth. He was baptised in [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], on 7 July 1865 by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Charles Longley]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>His godparents were the [[George V of Hanover|King of Hanover]] (Queen Victoria's cousin, for whom [[Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] stood proxy); the [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (Prince Albert's brother, for whom the [[Lord President of the Council]], [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Earl Granville]], stood proxy); the [[Ernst Leopold, 4th Prince of Leiningen|Prince of Leiningen]] (the Prince of Wales's half-cousin); the [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince of Denmark]] (the Princess of Wales's brother, for whom the [[Lord Chamberlain]], [[John Townshend, 1st Earl Sydney|Viscount Sydney]], stood proxy); the [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen of Denmark]] (George's maternal grandmother, for whom Queen Victoria stood proxy); the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] (Queen Victoria's cousin); the [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel|Duchess of Cambridge]] (Queen Victoria's aunt, for whom George's aunt [[Princess Helena of the United Kingdom|Princess Helena]] stood proxy); and [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom|Princess Louis of Hesse and by Rhine]] (George's aunt, for whom her sister [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]] stood proxy) (''The Times'' (London), Saturday, 8 July 1865, p. 12).</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

As a younger son of the Prince of Wales, there was little expectation that George would become king. He was third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother, [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]]. George was only 17&amp;nbsp;months younger than Albert Victor, and the two princes were educated together. [[John Neale Dalton]] was appointed as their tutor in 1871. Neither Albert Victor nor George excelled intellectually.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Clay, p. 39; Sinclair, pp. 46–47</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> As their father thought that the navy was &quot;the very best possible training for any boy&quot;,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Sinclair, pp. 49–50</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> in September 1877, when George was 12&amp;nbsp;years old, both brothers joined the cadet training ship [[HMS Prince of Wales (1860)|HMS ''Britannia'']] at [[Dartmouth, Devon]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Clay, p. 71; Rose, p. 7</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

For three years from 1879, the royal brothers served on <template><title>HMS</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Bacchante</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>1876</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>6</value></part></template>, accompanied by Dalton. They toured the colonies of the [[British Empire]] in the [[Caribbean]], South Africa and Australia, and visited [[Norfolk, Virginia]], as well as South America, the [[Mediterranean]], Egypt, and East Asia. In 1881 on a visit to Japan, George had a local artist tattoo a blue and red dragon on his arm,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Rose, p. 13</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> and was received in an audience by the [[Emperor Meiji]]; George and his brother presented [[Empress Haruko]] with two [[wallaby|wallabies]] from Australia.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Keene, Donald ''Emperor of Japan: Meiji and His World, 1852–1912 ''(Columbia University Press, 2002) pgs. 350–351</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Dalton wrote an account of their journey entitled ''The Cruise of HMS Bacchante''.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Rose, p. 14; Sinclair, p. 55</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Between Melbourne and Sydney, Dalton recorded a sighting of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'', a mythical ghost ship.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Rose, p. 11</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> When they returned to Britain, Queen Victoria complained that her grandsons could not speak French or German, and so they spent six months in [[Lausanne]] in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to learn another language.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Clay, p. 92; Rose, pp. 15–16</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> After Lausanne, the brothers were separated; Albert Victor attended [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], while George continued in the [[Royal Navy]].

[[File:Kinggeorgev1928.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Pale-eyed young man with a beard and moustache|George, 1893]]

As a young man destined to serve in the navy, Prince George served for many years under the command of his uncle, [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]], who was stationed in [[Malta]]. There, he grew close to and fell in love with his uncle's daughter, his first cousin, [[Marie of Romania|Marie of Edinburgh]]. His grandmother, father and uncle all approved the match, but the mothers—the Princess of Wales and the [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Duchess of Edinburgh]]—both opposed it. The Princess of Wales thought the family was too pro-German, and the Duchess of Edinburgh disliked England. Marie's mother was the only daughter of the Tsar of Russia. She resented the fact that, as the wife of a younger son of the British sovereign, she had to yield precedence to George's mother, the Princess of Wales, whose father had been a minor German prince before being called unexpectedly to the throne of Denmark. Guided by her mother, Marie refused George when he proposed to her. She married [[Ferdinand of Romania|Ferdinand]], the heir to the [[King of Romania]], in 1893.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Pope-Hennessy, pp. 250–251</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

In November 1891, George's elder brother [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Albert Victor]] became engaged to his [[Cousin#Cousin chart|second cousin once removed]], [[Mary of Teck|Princess Victoria Mary of Teck]]. She was known within the family as &quot;May&quot;, nicknamed after her birth month. May's father, [[Francis, Duke of Teck|Prince Francis, Duke of Teck]], belonged to a [[morganatic]], cadet branch of the [[house of Württemberg]]. Her mother, [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge]], was a male-line granddaughter of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George&amp;nbsp;III]] and a first cousin of Queen Victoria.

On 14 January 1892, six weeks after the formal engagement, Albert Victor died of [[pneumonia]], leaving George second in line to the throne, and likely to succeed after his father. George had only just recovered from a serious illness himself, after being confined to bed for six weeks with [[typhoid fever]], the disease that was thought to have killed his grandfather Prince Albert.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Rose, pp. 20–21, 24</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Queen Victoria still regarded Princess May<comment>&lt;!--Yes, May!

Throughout their lives, they remained devoted to each other. George was, on his own admission, unable to express his feelings easily in speech, but they often exchanged loving letters and notes of endearment.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Sinclair, p. 178</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

The Duke and Duchess of York lived mainly at York Cottage,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Renamed from ''Bachelor's Cottage''</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> a relatively small house in [[Sandringham, Norfolk]], where their way of life mirrored that of a comfortable middle-class family rather than royalty.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Clay, p. 154; Nicolson, p. 51; Rose, p. 97</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> George preferred a simple, almost quiet, life in marked contrast to the lively social life pursued by his father. His official biographer, [[Harold Nicolson]], later despaired of George's time as Duke of York, writing: &quot;He may be all right as a young midshipman and a wise old king, but when he was Duke of York&amp;nbsp;... he did nothing at all but kill [''i.e.'' shoot] animals and stick in stamps.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[[Harold Nicolson]]'s diary quoted in Sinclair, p. 107</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> George was an avid [[stamp collector]], which Nicolson disparaged,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Nicolson's ''Comments 1944–1948'', quoted in Rose, p. 42</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> but George played a large role in building the [[Royal Philatelic Collection]] into the most comprehensive collection of United Kingdom and Commonwealth stamps in the world, in some cases setting record purchase prices for items.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/The%20Royal%20Collection%20and%20other%20collections/TheRoyalPhilatelicCollection/History.aspx|title=The Royal Philatelic Collection|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

George and May had five sons and a daughter. [[Randolph Churchill]] claimed that George was a strict father, to the extent that his children were terrified of him, and that George had remarked to [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby]]: &quot;My father was frightened of his mother, I was frightened of my father, and I am damned well going to see to it that my children are frightened of me.&quot; In reality, there is no direct source for the quotation and it is likely that George's parenting style was little different from that adopted by most people at the time.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Rose, pp. 53–57; Sinclair, p. 93 ''ff''</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

In October 1894, George's uncle-by-marriage, [[Tsar Alexander III]], died and his cousin, [[Tsar Nicholas II]], ascended the Russian throne. At the request of his father, &quot;out of respect for poor dear Uncle Sasha's memory&quot;, George joined his parents in St. Petersburg for the funeral.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Clay, p. 167</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> George and his parents remained in Russia for the wedding a week later of Nicholas to another one of George's first cousins, [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Princess Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt]], whom Queen Victoria had once hoped would marry George's elder brother.

As Duke and Duchess of York, George and May<comment>&lt;!--Yes, May! Please do not edit--&gt;</comment> carried out a wide variety of public duties. On the death of [[Queen Victoria]] on 22 January 1901, George's father ascended the throne as [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]]. George inherited the titles of [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay]], and for much of the rest of that year, he was styled ''His Royal Highness The Duke of Cornwall and York''.

In 1901, George and May toured the [[British Empire]]. Their tour included Malta, Ceylon, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the [[Colony of Newfoundland]]. The tour was designed by Colonial Secretary [[Joseph Chamberlain]] with the support of Prime Minister [[Lord Salisbury]] to reward the dominions for their participation in the [[South African War]] of 1899–1902. George presented thousands of specially designed South African War medals to colonial troops. In South Africa, the royal party met civic leaders, African leaders, and Boer prisoners, and was greeted by elaborate decorations, expensive gifts, and fireworks displays. Despite this, not all residents responded favourably to the tour. Many white Cape [[Afrikaner]]s resented the display and expense, the war having weakened their capacity to reconcile their Afrikaner-Dutch culture with their status as British subjects. Critics in the English-language press decried the enormous cost at a time when families faced severe hardship.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Phillip Buckner, &quot;The Royal Tour of 1901 and the Construction of an Imperial Identity in South Africa.&quot; '' South African Historical Journal''  2000 (41): 324–348.

George had never liked his wife's habit of signing official documents and letters as &quot;Victoria Mary&quot; and insisted she drop one of those names.

George objected to the anti-Catholic wording of the Accession Declaration that he would be required to make at the opening of his first parliament.

From 1914 to 1918, [[Allies of World War I|Britain and its allies]] were at [[World War I|war]] with the [[Central Powers]], led by the [[German Empire]]. The German Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], who for the British public came to symbolise all the horrors of the war, was the King's first cousin. The King's paternal grandfather was [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]; consequently, the King and his children bore the titles Prince and Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke and Duchess of Saxony. Queen Mary, although British like her mother, was the daughter of the [[Duke of Teck]], a descendant of the German [[Dukes of Württemberg]]. The King had brothers-in-law and cousins who were British subjects but who bore German titles such as Duke and Duchess of Teck, Prince and Princess of Battenberg, and Prince and Princess of Schleswig-Holstein. When [[H. G. Wells]] wrote about Britain's &quot;alien and uninspiring court&quot;, George famously replied: &quot;I may be uninspiring, but I'll be damned if I'm alien.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Nicolson, p. 308</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

On 17 July 1917, George appeased British nationalist feelings by issuing a royal proclamation that changed the name of the British [[royal house]] from the German-sounding [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] to the [[House of Windsor]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{London Gazette|issue=30186|date=17 July 1917|startpage=7119|accessdate=20 February 2011}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> He and all his British relatives relinquished their German titles and styles, and adopted British-sounding surnames. George compensated his male relatives by creating them British peers. His cousin, [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]], who earlier in the war had been forced to resign as [[First Sea Lord]] through anti-German feeling, became Louis Mountbatten, 1st Marquess of Milford Haven, while Queen Mary's brothers became [[Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge]], and [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Rose, pp. 174–175</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> George's cousins [[Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein|Princess Marie Louise]] and [[Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein]] dropped their territorial designations.

In [[Letters Patent]] gazetted on 11 December 1917 the King restricted the style &quot;His (or Her) Royal Highness&quot; and the titular dignity of &quot;Prince (or Princess) of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; to the children of the Sovereign, the children of the sons of the Sovereign and the eldest living son of the eldest living son of a Prince of Wales.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Nicolson, p. 310</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The Letters Patent also stated that &quot;the titles of Royal Highness, Highness or Serene Highness, and the titular dignity of Prince and Princess shall cease except those titles already granted and remaining unrevoked&quot;.

When [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II of Russia]], George's first cousin (their mothers were sisters), was overthrown in the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], the British government offered [[political asylum]] to the Tsar and his family, but worsening conditions for the British people, and fears that revolution might come to the British Isles, led George V to think that the presence of the Russian royals might seem inappropriate in the circumstances.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Nicolson, p. 301; Rose, pp. 210–215; Sinclair, p. 148</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Despite the later claims of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]] that Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]] was opposed to the rescue of the Russian imperial family, the letters of [[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Lord Stamfordham]] suggest that it was George&amp;nbsp;V who opposed the rescue against the advice of the government.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Rose, p. 210</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Advanced planning for a rescue was undertaken by [[MI1]], a branch of the British secret service,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{citation|last=Crossland|first=John|title=British Spies In Plot To Save Tsar|journal=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]|date=15 October 2006}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> but because of the strengthening position of the [[Bolshevik]] revolutionaries and wider difficulties with the conduct of the war, the plan was never put into operation.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Sinclair, p. 149</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The Tsar and his immediate family remained in Russia, where they were killed by Bolsheviks in 1918.

Two months after the end of the war, the King's youngest son, [[Prince John of the United Kingdom|John]], died at the age of 13 after a lifetime of ill health. George was informed of his death by Queen Mary, who wrote, &quot;[John] had been a great anxiety to us for many years&amp;nbsp;...

Before the First World War, most of Europe was ruled by monarchs related to George, but during and after the war, the monarchies of Austria, Germany, Greece, and Spain, like Russia, fell to revolution and war. In March 1919, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Lisle Strutt]] was dispatched on the personal authority of the King to escort the former Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] and his family to safety in Switzerland.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{citation| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/royalty-obituaries/8616240/Archduke-Otto-von-Habsburg.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Archduke Otto von Habsburg | date=4 July 2011}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> In 1922, a [[Royal Navy]] ship was sent to Greece to rescue his cousins, Prince and Princess Andrew. [[Prince Andrew of Greece and Denmark|Prince Andrew]] was a nephew of [[Queen Alexandra]] through her brother King [[George I of Greece]], and [[Princess Alice of Battenberg|Princess Andrew]] was a daughter of [[Prince Louis of Battenberg]], one of the German princes granted a British peerage in 1917. Their children included [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]], who would later marry George's granddaughter, [[Elizabeth II]]. The Greek monarchy was restored again shortly before George's death.

Political turmoil in Ireland continued as the Nationalists [[Irish War of Independence|fought for independence]]; George expressed his horror at government-sanctioned killings and reprisals to Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Nicolson, p. 347; Rose, pp. 238–241; Sinclair, p. 114</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> At the opening session of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] on 22 June 1921, the King, in a speech part drafted by Lloyd George and General [[Jan Smuts]], appealed for conciliation. A few weeks later, a truce was agreed. Negotiations between Britain and the Irish secessionists led to the signing of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. By the end of 1922, [[Partition of Ireland|Ireland was partitioned]], the [[Irish Free State]] was established, and Lloyd George was out of office.

The King and his leading advisers were concerned about the rise of socialism and the growing labour movement, which they associated with republicanism. Their concerns, although exaggerated, resulted in a redesign of the monarchy's social role to be more inclusive of the working class and its representatives—a dramatic change for George, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. In fact the socialists no longer believed in their anti-monarchical slogans and were ready to come to terms with the monarchy if it took the first step. George took that step, adopting a more democratic stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public. The King also cultivated friendly relations with moderate [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] politicians and trade union officials. George V's abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter. The years between 1922 and 1929 saw frequent changes in government. In 1924, George appointed the first Labour Prime Minister, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], in the absence of a clear majority for any one of the three major parties. George's tactful and understanding reception of the first Labour government (which lasted less than a year) allayed the suspicions of the party's sympathisers.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Prochaska, Frank (1999) &quot;George V and Republicanism, 1917–1919&quot;, ''Twentieth Century British History'' '''10''' (1): 27–51; Kirk, Neville (2005) &quot;The Conditions of Royal Rule: Australian and British Socialist and Labour Attitudes to the Monarchy, 1901–11&quot;, ''Social History'' '''30''' (1): 64–88</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> During the [[UK General Strike of 1926|General Strike of 1926]] the King advised the government of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Stanley Baldwin]] against taking inflammatory action,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Nicolson, p. 419; Rose, pp. 341–342</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> and took exception to suggestions that the strikers were &quot;revolutionaries&quot; saying, &quot;Try living on their wages before you judge them.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Rose, p. 340; Sinclair, p. 105</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

In 1926, George hosted an [[Imperial Conference]] in London at which the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926|Balfour Declaration]] accepted the growth of the [[British Dominions]] into self-governing &quot;autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another&quot;. In 1931, the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] formalised George's position as &quot;the symbol of the free association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations&quot;. The Statute established &quot;that any alteration in the law touching the Succession to the Throne or the Royal Style and Titles&quot; would require the assent of the Parliaments of the Dominions as well as Parliament at Westminster, which could not legislate for the Dominions, except by consent.

In the wake of a [[Great Depression|world financial crisis]], the King encouraged the formation of a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Rose, pp. 373–379&quot;</attr><inner>Rose, pp. 373–379</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[[Vernon Bogdanor]] argues that George V played a crucial and active role in the political crisis of August–October 1931, and was a determining influence on Prime Minister MacDonald, in Bogdanor, Vernon (1991) [http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/2/1/1 &quot;1931 Revisited: The Constitutional Aspects&quot;], ''Twentieth Century British History'' '''2''' (1): 1–25 (Subscription required).

He was concerned by the rise to power in [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in 1933 of [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]].

As Duke of York, George's arms were the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|royal arms]], with an [[inescutcheon]] of the [[Coat of arms of Saxony|arms of Saxony]], all differenced with a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points [[argent]], the centre point bearing an anchor [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]]. As Prince of Wales the centre label lost its anchor. As King, he bore the royal arms. In 1917, he removed, by warrant, the Saxony inescutcheon from the arms of all male-line descendants of the Prince Consort domiciled in the United Kingdom (although the royal arms themselves had never borne the shield).<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Velde, François (19 April 2008), [http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/cadency.htm &quot;Marks of Cadency in the British Royal Family&quot;], Heraldica, retrieved 1 May 2010.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>
