Parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism, with [[multi-core]] and [[Symmetric multiprocessing|multi-processor]] computers having multiple processing elements within a single machine, while [[Computer cluster|clusters]], [[Massively parallel (computing)|MPPs]], and [[Grid computing|grids]] use multiple computers to work on the same task. Specialized parallel computer architectures are sometimes used alongside traditional processors, for accelerating specific tasks.

The maximum possible [[speedup|speed-up]] of a program as a result of parallelization is known as [[Amdahl's law]].

<h level="2" i="1">==Background==</h>
Traditionally, computer software has been written for serial computation. To solve a problem, an [[algorithm]] is constructed and implemented as a serial stream of instructions. These instructions are executed on a [[central processing unit]] on one computer. Only one instruction may execute at a time—after that instruction is finished, the next is executed.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;llnltut&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web |url=http://www.llnl.gov/computing/tutorials/parallel_comp/ |title=Introduction to Parallel Computing |accessdate=2007-11-09 |author=Barney, Blaise |publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Parallel computing, on the other hand, uses multiple processing elements simultaneously to solve a problem. This is accomplished by breaking the problem into independent parts so that each processing element can execute its part of the algorithm simultaneously with the others. The processing elements can be diverse and include resources such as a single computer with multiple processors, several networked computers, specialized hardware, or any combination of the above.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;llnltut&quot; </attr></ext>

[[Frequency scaling]] was the dominant reason for improvements in computer performance from the mid-1980s until 2004. The runtime of a program is equal to the number of instructions multiplied by the average time per instruction. Maintaining everything else constant, increasing the clock frequency decreases the average time it takes to execute an instruction. An increase in frequency thus decreases runtime for all [[CPU bound|compute-bound]] programs.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book|last=Hennessy|first=John L.|title=Computer architecture / a quantitative approach.|year=2002|publisher=International Thomson|location=San Francisco, Calif.|isbn=1-55860-724-2|edition=3rd|coauthors=Patterson, David A.|page=43}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

However, power consumption by a chip is given by the equation P = C × V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × F, where P is power, C is the [[capacitance]] being switched per clock cycle (proportional to the number of transistors whose inputs change), V is [[voltage]], and F is the processor frequency (cycles per second).<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book|last=Rabaey|first=Jan M.|title=Digital integrated circuits : a design perspective|year=1996|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0-13-178609-1|page=235}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Increases in frequency increase the amount of power used in a processor. Increasing processor power consumption led ultimately to [[Intel]]'s May 2004 cancellation of its [[Tejas and Jayhawk]] processors, which is generally cited as the end of frequency scaling as the dominant computer architecture paradigm.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite news|last=Flynn|first=Laurie J.|title=Intel Halts Development Of 2 New Microprocessors|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/08/business/08chip.html?ex=1399348800&amp;en=98cc44ca97b1a562&amp;ei=5007|accessdate=5 June 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=8 May 2004}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="3" i="2">===Amdahl's law and Gustafson's law===</h>
[[File:AmdahlsLaw.svg|right|thumbnail|300px|A graphical representation of [[Amdahl's law]]. The speed-up of a program from parallelization is limited by how much of the program can be parallelized. For example, if 90% of the program can be parallelized, the theoretical maximum speed-up using parallel computing would be 10x no matter how many processors are used.]]

Optimally, the speed-up from parallelization would be linear—doubling the number of processing elements should halve the runtime, and doubling it a second time should again halve the runtime. However, very few parallel algorithms achieve optimal speed-up. Most of them have a near-linear speed-up for small numbers of processing elements, which flattens out into a constant value for large numbers of processing elements.

The potential speed-up of an algorithm on a parallel computing platform is given by [[Amdahl's law]], originally formulated by [[Gene Amdahl]] in the 1960s.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal|last=Amdahl|first=Gene M.|title=Validity of the single processor approach to achieving large scale computing capabilities|journal=Proceeding AFIPS '67 (Spring) Proceedings of the April 18–20, 1967, spring joint computer conference|pages=483–485|doi=10.1145/1465482.1465560|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=160438|year=1967}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> It states that a small portion of the program which cannot be parallelized will limit the overall speed-up available from parallelization.  A program solving a large mathematical or engineering problem will typically consist of several parallelizable parts and several non-parallelizable (sequential) parts. If <ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner>\alpha</inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext> is the fraction of running time a program spends on non-parallelizable parts, then:

<ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner>\lim_{P\to\infty}\frac{1}{\frac{1-\alpha}{P}+\alpha} = \frac{1}{\alpha}</inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext>

is the maximum speed-up with parallelization of the program. If the sequential portion of a program accounts for 10% of the runtime (<ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner>\alpha=0.1</inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext>), we can get no more than a 10× speed-up, regardless of how many processors are added. This puts an upper limit on the usefulness of adding more parallel execution units. &quot;When a task cannot be partitioned because of sequential constraints, the application of more effort has no effect on the schedule. The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book|last=Brooks|first=Frederick P.|title=The mythical man month essays on software engineering|year=1996|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, Mass.

[[Gustafson's law]] is another law in computing, closely related to Amdahl's law.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal|last=Gustafson|first=John L.|title=Reevaluating Amdahl's law|journal=Communications of the ACM|year=1988|month=May|volume=31|issue=5|pages=532–533|doi=10.1145/42411.42415|url=http://www.scl.ameslab.gov/Publications/Gus/AmdahlsLaw/Amdahls.html}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> It states that the speedup with <ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner>P</inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext> processors is

[[Image:Optimizing-different-parts.svg|thumb|400px|Assume that a task has two independent parts, A and B. B takes roughly 25% of the time of the whole computation. With effort, a [[programmer]] may be able to make this part five times faster, but this only reduces the time for the whole computation by a little. In contrast, one may need to perform less work to make part&amp;nbsp;A twice as fast. This will make the computation much faster than by optimizing part&amp;nbsp;B, even though B got a greater speed-up (5× versus 2×).]]

Both Amdahl's law and Gustafson's law assume that the running time of the sequential portion of the program is independent of the number of processors. Amdahl's law assumes that the entire problem is of fixed size so that the total amount of work to be done in parallel is also ''independent of the number of processors'', whereas Gustafson's law assumes that the total amount of work to be done in parallel ''varies linearly with the number of processors''.

<h level="3" i="3">===Dependencies===</h>
Understanding [[data dependency|data dependencies]] is fundamental in implementing [[parallel algorithm]]s. No program can run more quickly than the longest chain of dependent calculations (known as the [[Critical path method|critical path]]), since calculations that depend upon prior calculations in the chain must be executed in order. However, most algorithms do not consist of just a long chain of dependent calculations; there are usually opportunities to execute independent calculations in parallel.

Let P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; be two program segments. Bernstein's conditions<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal|last=Bernstein|first=A.

For ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, let ''I''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; be all of the input variables and ''O''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; the output variables, and likewise for ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. ''P'' &lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are independent if they satisfy

* <ext><name>math</name><attr/><inner> O_i \cap O_j = \varnothing. \, </inner><close>&lt;/math&gt;</close></ext>

Violation of the first condition introduces a flow dependency, corresponding to the first segment producing a result used by the second segment. The second condition represents an anti-dependency, when the second segment (''P''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) produces a variable needed by the first segment (''P''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;). The third and final condition represents an output dependency: When two segments write to the same location, the result comes from the logically last executed segment.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book|last=Roosta|first=Seyed H.|title=Parallel processing and parallel algorithms : theory and computation|year=2000|publisher=Springer|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0-387-98716-9|page=114}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Consider the following functions, which demonstrate several kinds of dependencies:

 1: function Dep(a, b)
 2: c := a·b
 3: d := 3·c
 4: end function

Operation 3 in Dep(a, b) cannot be executed before (or even in parallel with) operation&amp;nbsp;2, because operation&amp;nbsp;3 uses a result from operation&amp;nbsp;2. It violates condition&amp;nbsp;1, and thus introduces a flow dependency.

 1: function NoDep(a, b)
 2: c := a·b
 3: d := 3·b
 4: e := a+b
 5: end function

In this example, there are no dependencies between the instructions, so they can all be run in parallel.

Bernstein’s conditions do not allow memory to be shared between different processes. For that, some means of enforcing an ordering between accesses is necessary, such as [[semaphore (programming)|semaphores]], [[barrier (computer science)|barriers]] or some other [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization method]].

<h level="3" i="4">===Race conditions, mutual exclusion, synchronization, and parallel slowdown===</h>
Subtasks in a parallel program are often called [[Thread (computing)|threads]]. Some parallel computer architectures use smaller, lightweight versions of threads known as [[Fiber (computer science)|fibers]], while others use bigger versions known as [[Process (computing)|processes]]. However, &quot;threads&quot; is generally accepted as a generic term for subtasks. Threads will often need to update some [[variable (programming)|variable]] that is shared between them. The instructions between the two programs may be interleaved in any order. For example, consider the following program:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|Thread A
|Thread B
|-
|1A: Read variable V
|1B: Read variable V
|-
|2A: Add 1 to variable V
|2B: Add 1 to variable V
|-
|3A Write back to variable V
|3B: Write back to variable V
|}

If instruction 1B is executed between 1A and 3A, or if instruction 1A is executed between 1B and 3B, the program will produce incorrect data. This is known as a [[race condition]]. The programmer must use a [[Lock (computer science)|lock]] to provide [[mutual exclusion]]. A lock is a programming language construct that allows one thread to take control of a variable and prevent other threads from reading or writing it, until that variable is unlocked. The thread holding the lock is free to execute its [[critical section]] (the section of a program that requires exclusive access to some variable), and to unlock the data when it is finished. Therefore, to guarantee correct program execution, the above program can be rewritten to use locks:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|Thread A
|Thread B
|-
|1A: Lock variable V
|1B: Lock variable V
|-
|2A: Read variable V
|2B: Read variable V
|-
|3A: Add 1 to variable V
|3B: Add 1 to variable V
|-
|4A Write back to variable V
|4B: Write back to variable V
|-
|5A: Unlock variable V
|5B: Unlock variable V
|}

One thread will successfully lock variable V, while the other thread will be [[Software lockout|locked out]]—unable to proceed until V is unlocked again. This guarantees correct execution of the program. Locks, while necessary to ensure correct program execution, can greatly slow a program.

Locking multiple variables using [[Atomic operation|non-atomic]] locks introduces the possibility of program [[deadlock]]. An atomic lock locks multiple variables all at once. If it cannot lock all of them, it does not lock any of them. If two threads each need to lock the same two variables using non-atomic locks, it is possible that one thread will lock one of them and the second thread will lock the second variable. In such a case, neither thread can complete, and deadlock results.

Many parallel programs require that their subtasks [[Synchronization (computer science)|act in synchrony]]. This requires the use of a [[barrier (computer science)|barrier]]. Barriers are typically implemented using a software lock. One class of algorithms, known as [[lock-free and wait-free algorithms]], altogether avoids the use of locks and barriers. However, this approach is generally difficult to implement and requires correctly designed data structures.

Not all parallelization results in speed-up. Generally, as a task is split up into more and more threads, those threads spend an ever-increasing portion of their time communicating with each other. Eventually, the overhead from communication dominates the time spent solving the problem, and further parallelization (that is, splitting the workload over even more threads) increases rather than decreases the amount of time required to finish. This is known as [[parallel slowdown]].

<h level="3" i="5">===Fine-grained, coarse-grained, and embarrassing parallelism===</h>
Applications are often classified according to how often their subtasks need to synchronize or communicate with each other. An application exhibits fine-grained parallelism if its subtasks must communicate many times per second; it exhibits coarse-grained parallelism if they do not communicate many times per second, and it is [[embarrassingly parallel]] if they rarely or never have to communicate. Embarrassingly parallel applications are considered the easiest to parallelize.

<h level="3" i="6">===Consistency models===</h>
<template lineStart="1"><title>Main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Consistency model</value></part></template>

Parallel programming languages and parallel computers must have a [[consistency model]] (also known as a memory model). The consistency model defines rules for how operations on [[Computer data storage|computer memory]] occur and how results are produced.

One of the first consistency models was [[Leslie Lamport]]'s [[sequential consistency]] model. Sequential consistency is the property of a parallel program that its parallel execution produces the same results as a sequential program. Specifically, a program is sequentially consistent if &quot;...&amp;nbsp;the results of any execution is the same as if the operations of all the processors were executed in some sequential order, and the operations of each individual processor appear in this sequence in the order specified by its program&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal|last=Lamport|first=Leslie|title=How to Make a Multiprocessor Computer That Correctly Executes Multiprocess Programs|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers|date=1 September 1979|volume=C-28|issue=9|pages=690–691|doi=10.1109/TC.1979.1675439}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

[[Software transactional memory]] is a common type of consistency model. Software transactional memory borrows from [[Database management system|database theory]] the concept of [[Atomic commit|atomic transactions]] and applies them to memory accesses.

Mathematically, these models can be represented in several ways. [[Petri net]]s, which were introduced in Carl Adam Petri's 1962 doctoral thesis, were an early attempt to codify the rules of consistency models. Dataflow theory later built upon these, and [[Dataflow architecture]]s were created to physically implement the ideas of dataflow theory. Beginning in the late 1970s, [[process calculi]] such as [[Calculus of Communicating Systems]] and [[Communicating Sequential Processes]] were developed to permit algebraic reasoning about systems composed of interacting components. More recent additions to the process calculus family, such as the [[pi calculus|π-calculus]], have added the capability for reasoning about dynamic topologies. Logics such as Lamport's [[Temporal logic of actions|TLA+]], and mathematical models such as [[Trace theory|traces]] and [[Actor model theory|Actor event diagrams]], have also been developed to describe the behavior of concurrent systems.

<h level="3" i="7">===Flynn's taxonomy===</h>
[[Michael J. Flynn]] created one of the earliest classification systems for parallel (and sequential) computers and programs, now known as [[Flynn's taxonomy]]. Flynn classified programs and computers by whether they were operating using a single set or multiple sets of instructions, and whether or not those instructions were using a single set or multiple sets of data.

<template lineStart="1"><title>Flynn's Taxonomy</title></template>

The single-instruction-single-data (SISD) classification is equivalent to an entirely sequential program. The single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) classification is analogous to doing the same operation repeatedly over a large data set. This is commonly done in [[signal processing]] applications. Multiple-instruction-single-data (MISD) is a rarely used classification. While computer architectures to deal with this were devised (such as [[systolic array]]s), few applications that fit this class materialized. Multiple-instruction-multiple-data (MIMD) programs are by far the most common type of parallel programs.

According to [[David A. Patterson (scientist)|David A. Patterson]] and [[John L. Hennessy]], &quot;Some machines are hybrids of these categories, of course, but this classic model has survived because it is simple, easy to understand, and gives a good first approximation. It is also—perhaps because of its understandability—the most widely used scheme.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Patterson and Hennessy, p.&amp;nbsp;748.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<template lineStart="1"><title>main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Bit-level parallelism</value></part></template>
From the advent of [[very-large-scale integration]] (VLSI) computer-chip fabrication technology in the 1970s until about 1986, speed-up in computer architecture was driven by doubling [[Word (data type)|computer word size]]—the amount of information the processor can manipulate per cycle.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book|last=Singh|first=David Culler ; J.P.|title=Parallel computer architecture|year=1997|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann Publ.|location=San Francisco|isbn=1-55860-343-3|page=15|edition=[Nachdr.]}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Increasing the word size reduces the number of instructions the processor must execute to perform an operation on variables whose sizes are greater than the length of the word. For example, where an [[8-bit]] processor must add two [[16-bit]] [[integer]]s, the processor must first add the 8&amp;nbsp;lower-order bits from each integer using the standard addition instruction, then add the 8&amp;nbsp;higher-order bits using an add-with-carry instruction and the [[carry bit]] from the lower order addition; thus, an 8-bit processor requires two instructions to complete a single operation, where a 16-bit processor would be able to complete the operation with a single instruction.

Historically, [[4-bit]] microprocessors were replaced with 8-bit, then 16-bit, then 32-bit microprocessors. This trend generally came to an end with the introduction of 32-bit processors, which has been a standard in general-purpose computing for two decades. Not until recently (c. 2003–2004), with the advent of [[x86-64]] architectures, have [[64-bit]] processors become commonplace.

A computer program is, in essence, a stream of instructions executed by a processor. These instructions can be [[Out-of-order execution|re-ordered]] and combined into groups which are then executed in parallel without changing the result of the program. This is known as instruction-level parallelism.

Modern processors have multi-stage [[instruction pipeline]]s. Each stage in the pipeline corresponds to a different action the processor performs on that instruction in that stage; a processor with an N-stage pipeline can have up to N different instructions at different stages of completion. The canonical example of a pipelined processor is a [[Reduced Instruction Set Computer|RISC]] processor, with five stages: instruction fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write back. The [[Pentium 4]] processor had a 35-stage pipeline.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[[Yale Patt|Patt, Yale]] (April 2004). &quot;[http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~patt/Videos/talk_videos/cmu_04-29-04.wmv The Microprocessor Ten Years From Now: What Are The Challenges, How Do We Meet Them?] (wmv).

In addition to instruction-level parallelism from pipelining, some processors can issue more than one instruction at a time. These are known as [[superscalar]] processors. Instructions can be grouped together only if there is no [[data dependency]] between them. [[Scoreboarding]] and the [[Tomasulo algorithm]] (which is similar to scoreboarding but makes use of [[register renaming]]) are two of the most common techniques for implementing out-of-order execution and instruction-level parallelism.

Main memory in a parallel computer is either [[shared memory]] (shared between all processing elements in a single [[address space]]), or [[distributed memory]] (in which each processing element has its own local address space).<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=PH713</attr><inner>Patterson and Hennessy, p.&amp;nbsp;713.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Distributed memory refers to the fact that the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. [[Distributed shared memory]] and [[memory virtualization]] combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.

[[Image:Numa.svg|right|thumbnail|400px|A logical view of a [[Non-Uniform Memory Access]] (NUMA) architecture. Processors in one directory can access that directory's memory with less latency than they can access memory in the other directory's memory.]]

Computer architectures in which each element of main memory can be accessed with equal [[Memory latency|latency]] and [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] are known as [[Uniform Memory Access]] (UMA) systems. Typically, that can be achieved only by a [[shared memory]] system, in which the memory is not physically distributed. A system that does not have this property is known as a [[Non-Uniform Memory Access]] (NUMA) architecture. Distributed memory systems have non-uniform memory access.

Computer systems make use of [[CPU cache|cache]]s—small, fast memories located close to the processor which store temporary copies of memory values (nearby in both the physical and logical sense). Parallel computer systems have difficulties with caches that may store the same value in more than one location, with the possibility of incorrect program execution. These computers require a [[cache coherency]] system, which keeps track of cached values and strategically purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. [[Bus sniffing|Bus snooping]] is one of the most common methods for keeping track of which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache coherence systems is a very difficult problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared-memory computer architectures do not scale as well as distributed memory systems do.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=PH713</attr></ext>

Processor–processor and processor–memory communication can be implemented in hardware in several ways, including via shared (either multiported or [[Multiplexing|multiplexed]]) memory, a [[crossbar switch]], a shared [[Bus (computing)|bus]] or an interconnect network of a myriad of [[network topology|topologies]] including [[Star network|star]], [[Ring network|ring]], [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]], [[Hypercube graph|hypercube]], fat hypercube (a hypercube with more than one processor at a node), or [[Mesh networking|n-dimensional mesh]].

Parallel computers based on interconnect networks need to have some kind of [[routing]] to enable the passing of messages between nodes that are not directly connected. The medium used for communication between the processors is likely to be hierarchical in large multiprocessor machines.

<h level="3" i="14">===Classes of parallel computers===</h>
Parallel computers can be roughly classified according to the level at which the hardware supports parallelism. This classification is broadly analogous to the distance between basic computing nodes. These are not mutually exclusive; for example, clusters of symmetric multiprocessors are relatively common.

<h level="4" i="15">====Multicore computing====</h>
<template lineStart="1"><title>main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Multi-core (computing)</value></part></template>
A multicore processor is a processor that includes multiple [[execution unit]]s (&quot;cores&quot;) on the same chip. These processors differ from [[superscalar]] processors, which can issue multiple instructions per cycle from one instruction stream (thread); in contrast, a multicore processor can issue multiple instructions per cycle from multiple instruction streams. Each core in a multicore processor can potentially be superscalar as well—that is, on every cycle, each core can issue multiple instructions from one instruction stream.

[[Simultaneous multithreading]] (of which Intel's [[HyperThreading]] is the best known) was an early form of pseudo-multicoreism. A processor capable of simultaneous multithreading has only one execution unit (&quot;core&quot;), but when that execution unit is idling (such as during a [[cache miss]]), it uses that execution unit to process a second thread. [[IBM]]'s [[Cell (microprocessor)|Cell microprocessor]], designed for use in the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 3]], is another prominent multicore processor.

A massively parallel processor (MPP) is a single computer with many networked processors.

<h level="5" i="20">=====Grid computing=====</h>
<template lineStart="1"><title>main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Distributed computing</value></part></template>
Distributed computing is the most distributed form of parallel computing. It makes use of computers communicating over the [[Internet]] to work on a given problem. Because of the low bandwidth and extremely high latency available on the Internet, distributed computing typically deals only with [[embarrassingly parallel]] problems. [[List of distributed computing projects|Many distributed computing applications]] have been created, of which [[SETI@home]] and [[Folding@home]] are the best-known examples.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=Scott|title=COMPUTER SCIENCE: Rough Times Ahead|journal=Science|volume=299|issue=5607|pages=668–669|doi=10.1126/science.1081623|year=2003|pmid=12560537}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Most grid computing applications use [[middleware]], software that sits between the operating system and the application to manage network resources and standardize the software interface. The most common distributed computing middleware is the [[Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing]] (BOINC). Often, distributed computing software makes use of &quot;spare cycles&quot;, performing computations at times when a computer is idling.

<h level="4" i="21">====Specialized parallel computers====</h>
Within parallel computing, there are specialized parallel devices that remain niche areas of interest. While not [[Domain-specific programming language|domain-specific]], they tend to be applicable to only a few classes of parallel problems.

<h level="5" i="22">=====Reconfigurable computing with field-programmable gate arrays=====</h>
[[Reconfigurable computing]] is the use of a [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA) as a co-processor to a general-purpose computer. An FPGA is, in essence, a computer chip that can rewire itself for a given task.

FPGAs can be programmed with [[hardware description language]]s such as [[VHDL]] or [[Verilog]]. However, programming in these languages can be tedious. Several vendors have created [[C to HDL]] languages that attempt to emulate the syntax and/or semantics of the [[C programming language]], with which most programmers are familiar. The best known C to HDL languages are [[Mitrionics|Mitrion-C]], [[Impulse C]], [[DIME-C]], and [[Handel-C]]. Specific subsets of [[SystemC]] based on C++ can also be used for this purpose.

AMD's decision to open its [[HyperTransport]] technology to third-party vendors has become the enabling technology for high-performance reconfigurable computing.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;DAmour&quot;</attr><inner>D'Amour, Michael R., Chief Operating Officer, [[DRC Computer Corporation]]. &quot;Standard Reconfigurable Computing&quot;.

Other GPU programming languages include [[BrookGPU]], [[PeakStream]], and [[RapidMind]]. Nvidia has also released specific products for computation in their [[Nvidia Tesla|Tesla series]].

[[File:Cray 1 IMG 9126.jpg|right|thumbnail|The [[Cray-1]] is the most famous vector processor.]]

A vector processor is a CPU or computer system that can execute the same instruction on large sets of data. &quot;Vector processors have high-level operations that work on linear arrays of numbers or vectors. An example vector operation is ''A'' = ''B'' × ''C'', where ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are each 64-element vectors of 64-bit [[floating point|floating-point]] numbers.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=PH751</attr><inner>Patterson and Hennessy, p.&amp;nbsp;751.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> They are closely related to Flynn's SIMD classification.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=PH751</attr></ext>

[[Cray]] computers became famous for their vector-processing computers in the 1970s and 1980s. However, vector processors—both as CPUs and as full computer systems—have generally disappeared. Modern [[Instruction set|processor instruction sets]] do include some vector processing instructions, such as with [[AltiVec]] and [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE).

[[:Category:Concurrent programming languages|Concurrent programming languages]], [[Library (computing)|libraries]], [[Application programming interface|APIs]], and [[parallel programming model]]s (such as [[Algorithmic skeleton|Algorithmic Skeletons]]) have been created for programming parallel computers. These can generally be divided into classes based on the assumptions they make about the underlying memory architecture—shared memory, distributed memory, or shared distributed memory. Shared memory programming languages communicate by manipulating shared memory variables. Distributed memory uses [[message passing]]. [[POSIX Threads]] and [[OpenMP]] are two of most widely used shared memory APIs, whereas [[Message Passing Interface]] (MPI) is the most widely used message-passing system API.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>The [http://awards.computer.org/ana/award/viewPastRecipients.action?id=16 Sidney Fernbach Award given to MPI inventor Bill Gropp] refers to MPI as &quot;the dominant HPC communications interface&quot;</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> One concept used in programming parallel programs is the [[Futures and promises|future concept]], where one part of a program promises to deliver a required datum to another part of a program at some future time.

[http://www.caps-entreprise.com CAPS entreprise] and [http://www.pathscale.com/ Pathscale] are also coordinating their effort to make [http://www.caps-entreprise.com/hmpp.html HMPP (Hybrid Multicore Parallel Programming)] directives an Open Standard denoted [[OpenHMPP]].
The [[OpenHMPP]] directive-based programming model offers a syntax to efficiently offload computations on hardware accelerators and to optimize data movement to/from the hardware memory. [[OpenHMPP]] directives describe remote procedure call (RPC) on an accelerator device (e.g. GPU) or more generally a set of cores. The directives annotate C or Fortran codes to describe two sets of functionalities: the offloading of procedures (denoted codelets) onto a remote device and the optimization of data transfers between the CPU main memory and the accelerator memory.

One of the hottest older languages that is recently being extended from embedded mobile and telephony to more general concurrent challenges and projects is [[Erlang (programming language)]]. See the wiki article for numerous references on these applications.
