<!-- Definition and symptoms -->
'''Asperger syndrome''' ('''AS'''), also known as '''Asperger's''', is a [[developmental disorder]] characterized by significant difficulties in [[Interpersonal relationships|social interaction]] and [[nonverbal communication]], along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests.<ref name=NIH2015/> As a milder [[autism spectrum disorder]] (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal [[language development|language]] and [[cognitive development|intelligence]].<ref name=ICD10>{{cite web|title=F84.5 Asperger syndrome|url=http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd10/browse/2015/en#/F84.5|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=13 March 2016|date=2015}}</ref> Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common.<ref name=McPart2006>{{cite journal |vauthors=McPartland J, Klin A |title= Asperger's syndrome |journal= Adolesc Med Clin |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=771–88 |year=2006 |pmid=17030291 |doi= 10.1016/j.admecli.2006.06.010}}</ref><ref name=Baskin>{{cite journal |vauthors=Baskin JH, Sperber M, Price BH |title= Asperger syndrome revisited |journal= Rev Neurol Dis |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=1–7 |year=2006 |pmid=16596080}}</ref> Symptoms usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life.<ref name=NIH2015/>

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) defines Asperger syndrome (AS) as one of the [[autism spectrum disorder]]s (ASD) or [[pervasive developmental disorder]]s (PDD), which are a [[spectrum disorder|spectrum of psychological conditions]] that are characterized by abnormalities of [[social interaction]] and communication that pervade the individual's functioning, and by restricted and repetitive interests and behavior. Like other psychological development disorders, ASD begins in infancy or childhood, has a steady course without remission or relapse, and has impairments that result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain.<ref name="ICD-10-F84.0">{{cite book |chapterurl=http://apps.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/?gf80.htm+f840 |year=2006 |title= International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems |edition= 10th ([[ICD-10]]) |author= World Health Organization |chapter= F84.

==Characteristics==
[[File: Autism-stacking-cans 2nd edit.jpg|thumb|People with Asperger syndrome often display restricted or specialized interests, such as this boy's interest in stacking cans.]]
As a [[pervasive developmental disorder]], Asperger syndrome is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than a single symptom. It is characterized by qualitative impairment in social interaction, by stereotyped and restricted patterns of behavior, activities and interests, and by no clinically significant delay in cognitive development or general delay in language.<ref name=BehaveNet>{{cite book |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition= 4th, text revision ([[DSM-IV-TR]]) |author= American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 |isbn=0-89042-025-4 |chapter= Diagnostic criteria for 299.80 Asperger's Disorder (AD) |chapterurl=http://www.behavenet.com/capsules/disorders/asperger.htm |accessdate=28 June 2007 |publisher=<!-- pacify Citation bot --> |location=<!-- pacify Citation bot --> }}</ref> Intense preoccupation with a narrow subject, one-sided [[verbosity]], restricted [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and physical clumsiness are typical of the condition, but are not required for diagnosis.<ref name=Klin/> Suicidal behavior appears to occur at rates similar to those without ASD.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hannon|first1=G|last2=Taylor|first2=EP|title=Suicidal behaviour in adolescents and young adults with ASD: findings from a systematic review.|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=December 2013|volume=33|issue=8|pages=1197–204|pmid=24201088|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2013.10.003}}</ref>

===Social interaction===
{{further|Asperger syndrome and interpersonal relationships}}

A lack of demonstrated [[empathy]] affects aspects of communal living for persons with Asperger syndrome.<ref name=Baskin/> Individuals with AS experience difficulties in basic elements of social interaction, which may include a failure to develop friendships or to seek shared enjoyments or achievements with others (for example, showing others objects of interest), a lack of social or emotional [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] (social "games" give-and-take mechanic), and impaired [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal behaviors]] in areas such as [[eye contact]], [[facial expression]], posture, and gesture.<ref name=McPart2006/>

People with AS may not be as withdrawn around others, compared with those with other, more debilitating forms of [[Autism spectrum|autism]]; they approach others, even if awkwardly. For example, a person with AS may engage in a one-sided, long-winded speech about a favorite topic, while misunderstanding or not recognizing the listener's feelings or reactions, such as a wish to change the topic of talk or end the interaction.<ref name=Klin/> This social awkwardness has been called "active but odd".<ref name=McPart2006/> This failure to react appropriately to social interaction may appear as disregard for other people's feelings, and may come across as insensitive.<ref name=Klin/> However, not all individuals with AS will approach others. Some of them may even display [[selective mutism]], speaking not at all to most people and excessively to specific people. Some may choose only to talk to people they like.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/912296-overview |work=Medscape eMedicine |title=Asperger's Syndrome |author=Brasic JR |date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2010}}</ref>

The cognitive ability of children with AS often allows them to articulate [[social norms]] in a laboratory context,<ref name=McPart2006/> where they may be able to show a theoretical understanding of other people's emotions; however, they typically have difficulty acting on this knowledge in fluid, real-life situations.<ref name=Klin/> People with AS may analyze and distill their observations of social interaction into rigid behavioral guidelines, and apply these rules in awkward ways, such as forced eye contact, resulting in a demeanor that appears rigid or socially naive. Childhood desire for companionship can become numbed through a history of failed social encounters.<ref name=McPart2006/>

The [[hypothesis]] that individuals with AS are predisposed to violent or criminal behavior has been investigated, but is not supported by data.<ref name="McPart2006"/><ref>{{cite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2008 |title= Offending behaviour in adults with Asperger syndrome |vauthors=Allen D, Evans C, Hider A, Hawkins S, Peckett H, Morgan H |pmid=17805955 |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0442-9 |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=748–58}}</ref> More evidence suggests children with AS are victims rather than victimizers.<ref name=Tsatsanis>{{cite journal |journal= Child Adolesc Psychiatr Clin N Am |year=2003 |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=47–63 |title=Outcome research in Asperger syndrome and autism |author= Tsatsanis KD |pmid=12512398 |url=http://www.childpsych.theclinics.com/article/PIIS1056499302000561/fulltext |doi=10.1016/S1056-4993(02)00056-1}}</ref> A 2008 review found that an overwhelming number of reported violent criminals with AS had coexisting [[psychiatric disorders]] such as [[schizoaffective disorder]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Newman SS, Ghaziuddin M |title=Violent crime in Asperger syndrome: the role of psychiatric comorbidity |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=38 |issue=10 |pages=1848–52 |year=2008 |pmid=18449633 |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0580-8}}</ref>

===Restricted and repetitive interests and behavior===
People with Asperger syndrome display behavior, interests, and activities that are restricted and repetitive and are sometimes abnormally intense or focused. They may stick to inflexible routines, move in [[Stereotypy|stereotyped]] and repetitive ways, preoccupy themselves with parts of objects or compulsive behaviors like lining thing up in patterns.<ref name=BehaveNet/>

Pursuit of specific and narrow areas of interest is one of the most striking possible features of AS.<ref name=McPart2006/> Individuals with AS may collect volumes of detailed information on a relatively narrow topic such as weather data or star names, without necessarily having a genuine understanding of the broader topic.<ref name=McPart2006/><ref name=Klin/> For example, a child might memorize camera model numbers while caring little about photography.<ref name=McPart2006/> This behavior is usually apparent by age 5 or 6.<ref name=McPart2006/> Although these special interests may change from time to time, they typically become more unusual and narrowly focused, and often dominate social interaction so much that the entire family may become immersed. Because narrow topics often capture the interest of children, this symptom may go unrecognized.<ref name=Klin/>

Stereotyped and repetitive motor behaviors are a core part of the diagnosis of AS and other ASDs.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |year=2005 |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=145–58 |title= Repetitive behavior profiles in Asperger syndrome and high-functioning autism |vauthors=South M, Ozonoff S, McMahon WM |doi=10.1007/s10803-004-1992-8 |pmid=15909401}}</ref> They include hand movements such as flapping or twisting, and complex whole-body movements.<ref name=BehaveNet/> These are typically repeated in longer bursts and look more voluntary or ritualistic than [[tic]]s, which are usually faster, less rhythmical and less often symmetrical.<ref name=RapinTS>{{cite journal |author= [[Isabelle Rapin|Rapin I]] |title= Autism spectrum disorders: relevance to Tourette syndrome |journal= Adv Neurol |volume=85 |pages=89–101 |year=2001 |pmid=11530449}}</ref>

According to the Adult Asperger Assessment (AAA) diagnostic test, a lack of interest in fiction and a positive preference towards non-fiction is common among adults with AS.<ref name=ASAdulthood/>

===Speech and language===
Although individuals with Asperger syndrome acquire language skills without significant general delay and their speech typically lacks significant abnormalities, [[language acquisition]] and use is often atypical.<ref name=Klin/> Abnormalities include [[verbosity]], abrupt transitions, literal interpretations and miscomprehension of nuance, use of metaphor meaningful only to the speaker, [[Auditory processing disorder|auditory perception deficits]], unusually [[Pedantic speech|pedantic]], [[Register (sociolinguistics)|formal]] or [[Idiosyncrasy#Psychiatry|idiosyncratic]] speech, and oddities in loudness, [[Tone (linguistics)|pitch]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]], and rhythm.<ref name=McPart2006/> [[Echolalia]] has also been observed in individuals with AS.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Frith U |title=Social communication and its disorder in autism and Asperger syndrome |journal=J. Psychopharmacol. (Oxford) |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=48–53 |date=January 1996 |pmid=22302727 |doi=10.1177/026988119601000108}}</ref>

Three aspects of communication patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and [[circumstantial speech]], and marked verbosity. Although [[inflection]] and intonation may be less rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may convey a sense of [[Coherence (linguistics)|incoherence]]; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide [[Context (language use)|context]] for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.<ref name=Klin/>

Children with AS may have an unusually sophisticated vocabulary at a young age and have been colloquially called "little professors", but have difficulty understanding [[figurative language]] and tend to use language literally.<ref name=McPart2006/> Children with AS appear to have particular weaknesses in areas of nonliteral language that include humor, irony, teasing, and sarcasm. Although individuals with AS usually understand the cognitive basis of [[humor]], they seem to lack understanding of the intent of humor to share enjoyment with others.<ref name=Kasari/> Despite strong evidence of impaired humor appreciation, anecdotal reports of humor in individuals with AS seem to challenge some psychological theories of AS and autism.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lyons V, Fitzgerald M |title= Humor in autism and Asperger syndrome |journal= J Autism Dev Disord |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=521–31 |year=2004 |pmid=15628606 |doi=10.1007/s10803-004-2547-8}}</ref>

==Causes==
{{Further|Causes of autism}}
Hans Asperger described common symptoms among his patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene has yet been identified, multiple factors are believed to play a role in the [[expressivity (genetics)|expression]] of autism, given the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] variability seen in children with AS.<ref name=McPart2006/><ref name="Foster"/> Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading).<ref name=NINDS/> Most research suggests that all [[Heritability of autism|autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms]], but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism.<ref name="McPart2006"/> There is probably a common group of genes where particular [[allele]]s render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.<ref name=NINDS/>

A few ASD cases have been linked to exposure to [[Teratology#Teratogenic agents|teratogens]] (agents that cause [[birth defect]]s) during the first eight weeks from [[Human fertilization|conception]]. Although this does not exclude the possibility that ASD can be initiated or affected later, it is strong evidence that it arises very early in development.<ref name=Arndt>{{cite journal |journal= Int J Dev Neurosci |year=2005 |volume=23 |issue=2–3 |pages=189–99 |title= The teratology of autism |vauthors=Arndt TL, Stodgell CJ, Rodier PM |doi=10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2004.11.001 |pmid=15749245}}</ref> Many [[environmental factor]]s have been hypothesized to act after birth, but none has been confirmed by scientific investigation.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Rutter M |title= Incidence of autism spectrum disorders: changes over time and their meaning |journal= Acta Paediatr |volume=94 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=2–15 |pmid=15858952 |doi= 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb01779.x |authorlink= Michael Rutter}}</ref>

The children lacked nonverbal communication skills, failed to demonstrate empathy with their peers, and were physically clumsy. Asperger called the condition "autistic psychopathy" and described it as primarily marked by [[social isolation]].<ref name=NINDS/> Fifty years later, several standardizations of AS as a [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] were tentatively proposed, many of which diverge significantly from Asperger's original work.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hippler K, Klicpera C |title=A retrospective analysis of the clinical case records of 'autistic psychopaths' diagnosed by Hans Asperger and his team at the University Children's Hospital, Vienna |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=358 |issue=1430 |pages=291–301 |date=February 2003 |pmid=12639327 |pmc=1693115 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2002.1197 }}</ref>

[[Lorna Wing]] popularized the term ''Asperger syndrome'' in the English-speaking medical community in her 1981 publication<ref>{{cite journal|author= Wing L |title= Asperger's syndrome: a clinical account |journal= Psychol Med |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=115–29 |year=1981|doi=10.1017/S0033291700053332 |pmid=7208735 |url=http://www.mugsy.org/wing2.htm |accessdate=15 August 2007| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817231015/http://www.mugsy.org/wing2.htm| archivedate= 17 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> of a series of case studies of children showing similar symptoms,<ref name="What'sSpecial"/> and [[Uta Frith]] translated Asperger's paper to English in 1991.<ref name=ha/> Sets of diagnostic criteria were outlined by Gillberg and Gillberg in 1989 and by Szatmari ''et al.'' in the same year.<ref name="Mattila">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mattila ML, Kielinen M, Jussila K |title= An epidemiological and diagnostic study of Asperger syndrome according to four sets of diagnostic criteria |journal= J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=636–46 |year=2007 |pmid=17450055|doi=10.1097/chi.0b013e318033ff42 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> AS became a standard diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the tenth edition of the [[World Health Organization]]'s diagnostic manual, ''International Classification of Diseases'' ([[ICD-10]]); in 1994, it was added to the fourth edition of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s diagnostic reference, ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' ([[DSM-IV]]).<ref name=NINDS/>

Hundreds of books, articles and websites now describe AS, and prevalence estimates have increased dramatically for ASD, with AS recognized as an important subgroup.<ref name="What'sSpecial"/> Whether it should be seen as distinct from high-functioning autism is a fundamental issue requiring further study,<ref name="Baskin"/> and there are questions about the [[empirical validation]] of the DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria.<ref name="Klin"/> In 2013, [[DSM-5]] eliminated AS as a separate diagnosis, folding it into the autism spectrum on a severity scale.<ref name=DSMV/>

People identifying with Asperger syndrome may refer to themselves in casual conversation as ''aspies'' (a term first used in print by Liane Holliday Willey in 1999).<ref>{{cite book |author= Willey LH |title= Pretending to be Normal: Living with Asperger's Syndrome |publisher= Jessica Kingsley |pages=71, 104 |year=1999 |isbn=1-85302-749-9}}</ref> The word ''[[neurotypical]]'' (abbreviated ''NT'') describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical, and is often used to refer to non-autistic people. The [[Internet]] has allowed individuals with AS to communicate with each other in a way that was not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal, forming a subculture composed of people with Asperger's. Internet sites like [[Wrong Planet]] have made it easier for individuals to connect.<ref name=Clarke/>

Some autistic people have advocated a shift in perception of autism spectrum disorders as complex [[syndrome]]s rather than diseases that must be cured. Proponents of this view reject the notion that there is an "ideal" brain configuration and that any deviation from the norm is [[Anatomical pathology|pathological]]; they promote tolerance for what they call [[neurodiversity]].<ref>{{cite book |author= Williams CC |chapter= In search of an Asperger |editor= Stoddart KP |title= Children, Youth and Adults with Asperger Syndrome: Integrating Multiple Perspectives |year=2005 |publisher= Jessica Kingsley |isbn=1-84310-319-2 |pages=242–52 |quote= The life prospects of people with AS would change if we shifted from viewing AS as a set of dysfunctions, to viewing it as a set of differences that have merit.}}</ref> These views are the basis for the [[Autism rights movement|autistic rights]] and [[Sociological and cultural aspects of autism#Autistic pride|autistic pride]] movements.<ref>{{cite book |author= Dakin CJ |chapter= Life on the outside: A personal perspective of Asperger syndrome |editor= Stoddart KP |title= Children, Youth and Adults with Asperger Syndrome: Integrating Multiple Perspectives |year=2005 |publisher= Jessica Kingsley |isbn=1-84310-319-2 |pages=352–61}}</ref> There is a contrast between the attitude of adults with self-identified AS, who typically do not want to be cured and are proud of their identity, and parents of children with AS, who typically seek assistance and a cure for their children.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Clarke J, van Amerom G |title= Asperger's syndrome: differences between parents' understanding and those diagnosed |journal= Soc Work Health Care |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=85–106 |year=2008 |pmid=18551831 |doi=10.1300/J010v46n03_05}}</ref>

Some researchers have argued that AS can be viewed as a different cognitive style, not a disorder,<ref name=Clarke/> and that it should be removed from the standard ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'', much as [[homosexuality]] was removed.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Disabil Soc |year=2009 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=343–55 |title=Reframing Asperger syndrome: lessons from other challenges to the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual'' and ICIDH approaches |author=Allred S |doi=10.1080/09687590902789511 }}</ref> In a 2002 paper, [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] wrote of those with AS, "In the social world, there is no great benefit to a precise eye for detail, but in the worlds of maths, computing, cataloging, music, linguistics, engineering, and science, such an eye for detail can lead to success rather than failure." Baron-Cohen cited two reasons why it might still be useful to consider AS to be a disability: to ensure provision for legally required special support, and to recognize emotional difficulties from reduced empathy.<ref name=BaronCohen2002/> Baron-Cohen argues that the genes for Asperger's combination of abilities have operated throughout recent [[human evolution]] and have made remarkable contributions to human history.<ref>{{cite book |title= Foundations of Evolutionary Psychology |chapter= The evolution of brain mechanisms for social behavior |author= Baron-Cohen S |pages=415–32 |editor1= Crawford C|editor2=Krebs D |publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum |year=2008 |isbn=0-8058-5957-8}}</ref>

By contrast, Pier Jaarsma and Welin wrote in 2011 that the "broad version of the neurodiversity claim, covering low-functioning as well as high-functioning autism, is problematic. Only a narrow conception of neurodiversity, referring exclusively to high-functioning autists, is reasonable."<ref name=Jaarsma>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jaarsma P, Welin S |title=Autism as a Natural Human Variation: Reflections on the Claims of the Neurodiversity Movement |journal=Health Care Anal |date=February 2011 |pmid=21311979 |doi=10.1007/s10728-011-0169-9 |url=http://www.imh.liu.se/avd_halsa_samhalle/filarkiv1/1.264263/JaarsmaWelin2011Autismasanaturalvariation.pdf |format=PDF |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=20–30}}</ref>  They say that "higher functioning" individuals with autism may "not [be] benefited with such a psychiatric defect-based diagnosis ... some of them are being harmed by it, because of the disrespect the diagnosis displays for their natural way of being", but "think that it is still reasonable to include other categories of autism in the psychiatric diagnostics. The narrow conception of the neurodiversity claim should be accepted but the broader claim should not."<ref name=Jaarsma />  [[Jonathan Mitchell (writer)|Jonathan Mitchell]], an [[autistic]] author and blogger who advocates a cure for autism, has described autism as having "prevented me from making a living or ever having a girlfriend. It's given me bad fine motor coordination problems where I can hardly write. I have an impaired ability to relate to people. I can't concentrate or get things done."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hamilton|first1=Jon|title=Shortage of Brain Tissue Hinders Autism Research|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/02/04/170835708/shortage-of-brain-tissue-sets-autism-research-back|website=NPR|accessdate=10 May 2015}}</ref>  He describes neurodiversity as a "tempting escape valve".<ref name="Solomon">{{cite news |work=New York |title=The autism rights movement |author=Solomon A |date=2008-05-25 |accessdate=2008-05-27 |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080527025140/http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/| archivedate= 27 May 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>
