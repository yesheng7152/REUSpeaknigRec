As a [[pervasive developmental disorder]], Asperger syndrome is distinguished by a pattern of symptoms rather than a single symptom.

A lack of demonstrated [[empathy]] affects aspects of communal living for persons with Asperger syndrome.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Baskin</attr></ext> Individuals with AS experience difficulties in basic elements of social interaction, which may include a failure to develop friendships or to seek shared enjoyments or achievements with others (for example, showing others objects of interest), a lack of social or emotional [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]] (social &quot;games&quot; give-and-take mechanic), and impaired [[Nonverbal communication|nonverbal behaviors]] in areas such as [[eye contact]], [[facial expression]], posture, and gesture.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=McPart2006</attr></ext>

People with AS may not be as withdrawn around others, compared with those with other, more debilitating forms of [[Autism spectrum|autism]]; they approach others, even if awkwardly. For example, a person with AS may engage in a one-sided, long-winded speech about a favorite topic, while misunderstanding or not recognizing the listener's feelings or reactions, such as a wish to change the topic of talk or end the interaction.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Klin</attr></ext> This social awkwardness has been called &quot;active but odd&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=McPart2006</attr></ext> This failure to react appropriately to social interaction may appear as disregard for other people's feelings, and may come across as insensitive.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Klin</attr></ext> However, not all individuals with AS will approach others.

<h level="3" i="4">===Restricted and repetitive interests and behavior===</h>
People with Asperger syndrome display behavior, interests, and activities that are restricted and repetitive and are sometimes abnormally intense or focused.

Three aspects of communication patterns are of clinical interest: poor prosody, tangential and [[circumstantial speech]], and marked verbosity. Although [[inflection]] and intonation may be less rigid or monotonic than in classic autism, people with AS often have a limited range of intonation: speech may be unusually fast, jerky or loud. Speech may convey a sense of [[Coherence (linguistics)|incoherence]]; the conversational style often includes monologues about topics that bore the listener, fails to provide [[Context (language use)|context]] for comments, or fails to suppress internal thoughts. Individuals with AS may fail to detect whether the listener is interested or engaged in the conversation. The speaker's conclusion or point may never be made, and attempts by the listener to elaborate on the speech's content or logic, or to shift to related topics, are often unsuccessful.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Klin</attr></ext>

Hans Asperger described common symptoms among his patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome.
