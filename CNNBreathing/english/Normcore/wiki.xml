Normcore wearers are people who do not wish to distinguish themselves from others by their clothing.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jun/22/end-of-the-hipster-flat-caps-and-beards |title=The End of the Hipster: How Flat Caps and Beards Stopped Being So Cool |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |author=Ferrier, Morwenna |date=June 21, 2014 |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> This is not to mean that they are unfashionable people who wear whatever comes to hand, but that they consciously choose clothes that are undistinguished – except, frequently, for a highly visible [[label]] to impart prestige. The &quot;normcore&quot; trend has been interpreted as a reaction to a fashion oversaturation resulting from ever faster-changing fashion trends.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;NZZ 30 May 2014&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite news|last=van Rooijen|first=Jeroen|title=Trendthema &quot;Normcore&quot;: Die Mittelpracht|url=http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/panorama/die-mittelpracht-1.18312015|accessdate=May 31, 2014|newspaper=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]|date=May 30, 2014}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Normcore clothes include everyday items of [[casual wear]] such as [[t-shirt]]s, [[hoodie]]s, short-sleeved shirts, [[jeans]] and [[chino pants]], but not items such as [[necktie]]s or [[blouse]]s. These clothes are worn by men and women alike, making normcore a unisex style.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;NZZ 30 May 2014&quot; </attr></ext>

Clothes that meet the &quot;normcore&quot; description are mainly sold by large fashion and retail chains such as [[Gap Inc.|The Gap]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Gap's normcore ads&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web|last1=Franzen|first1=Carl|title=Watch David Fincher's normcore ads for The Gap|url=http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/28/6079587/watch-david-finchers-normcore-ads-the-gap|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=6 September 2014}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> [[Jack &amp; Jones]], [[Superdry]], [[Esprit Holdings|Esprit]] and [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]].
