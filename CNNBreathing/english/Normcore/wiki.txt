'''Normcore''' is a [[unisex]] [[fashion trend]] characterized by unpretentious, average-looking clothing. The term combines the words "normal" and "hardcore", and was coined by K-Hole, a trend forecasting group.<ref>Williams, Alex (April 2, 2014).

Normcore wearers are people who do not wish to distinguish themselves from others by their clothing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jun/22/end-of-the-hipster-flat-caps-and-beards |title=The End of the Hipster: How Flat Caps and Beards Stopped Being So Cool |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |author=Ferrier, Morwenna |date=June 21, 2014 |accessdate=July 8, 2014}}</ref> This is not to mean that they are unfashionable people who wear whatever comes to hand, but that they consciously choose clothes that are undistinguished – except, frequently, for a highly visible [[label]] to impart prestige. The "normcore" trend has been interpreted as a reaction to a fashion oversaturation resulting from ever faster-changing fashion trends.<ref name="NZZ 30 May 2014">{{cite news|last=van Rooijen|first=Jeroen|title=Trendthema "Normcore": Die Mittelpracht|url=http://www.nzz.ch/aktuell/panorama/die-mittelpracht-1.18312015|accessdate=May 31, 2014|newspaper=[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]|date=May 30, 2014}}</ref>

Normcore clothes include everyday items of [[casual wear]] such as [[t-shirt]]s, [[hoodie]]s, short-sleeved shirts, [[jeans]] and [[chino pants]], but not items such as [[necktie]]s or [[blouse]]s. These clothes are worn by men and women alike, making normcore a unisex style.<ref name="NZZ 30 May 2014" />

Clothes that meet the "normcore" description are mainly sold by large fashion and retail chains such as [[Gap Inc.|The Gap]],<ref name="Gap's normcore ads">{{cite web|last1=Franzen|first1=Carl|title=Watch David Fincher's normcore ads for The Gap|url=http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/28/6079587/watch-david-finchers-normcore-ads-the-gap|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=6 September 2014}}</ref> [[Jack & Jones]], [[Superdry]], [[Esprit Holdings|Esprit]] and [[Abercrombie & Fitch]]. They are generally cheaply produced in East Asian countries. Many other retailers such as [[Marc O'Polo]], [[Woolrich]], [[Desigual]], [[Closed GmbH|Closed]] and [[Scotch and Soda (clothing)|Scotch & Soda]] produce normcore-like clothes combined with individual design ideas.<ref name="NZZ 30 May 2014" />
