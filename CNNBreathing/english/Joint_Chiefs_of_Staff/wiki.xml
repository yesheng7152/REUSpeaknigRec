The '''Joint Chiefs of Staff''' ('''JCS''') is a body of senior uniformed leaders in the [[United States Department of Defense]] who advise the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], the [[United States Homeland Security Council|Homeland Security Council]], the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and the [[President of the United States]] on military matters. The composition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is defined by statute and consists of the ''[[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]'' (''CJCS''), ''[[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]'' (''VCJCS''), and the Military Service Chiefs from <comment>&lt;!-- Comment: the Army Navy, USAF, and USMC--the USCG is not an &quot;armed force&quot; except in time of war when subordinated to the SecDef; ref ramains TITLE 10 &gt; Subtitle A &gt; PART I &gt; CHAPTER 5 &gt; § 151, para (a)(6)~~~~--&gt;</comment>the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army]], [[Chief of Naval Operations|Navy]], [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Air Force]], the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], and the [[Chief of the National Guard Bureau]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;armytimes&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite news |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2012/01/army-air-force-top-guard-officer-joins-joint-chiefs-010412w/ |title=Top Guard officer joins Joint Chiefs of Staff |work=Army Times |date=4 January 2012}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> all appointed by the President following [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmation.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000151----000-.html] 10 USC 151.

Following the [[Goldwater–Nichols Act]] in 1986, the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not have operational command authority, neither individually nor collectively, as the chain of command goes from the President to the Secretary of Defense, and from the Secretary of Defense to the [[Unified Combatant Command|Commanders of the Combatant Commands]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[[Title 10 of the United States Code|10 U.S.C.]] [http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C6.txt §162(b)]</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Goldwater–Nichols also created the office of Vice Chairman, and the Chairman is now designated as the ''principal military adviser'' to the Secretary of Defense, the Homeland Security Council, the National Security Council and to the President.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[[Title 10 of the United States Code|10 U.S.C]] [http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C5.txt §151(b)]</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

The '''Joint Staff''' ('''JS''') is a headquarters staff in the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], composed of personnel from each of the four Department of Defense armed services, that assists the Chairman and the Vice Chairman in discharging their responsibilities and is managed by the ''[[Director of the Joint Staff]]'' (''DJS'') who is a [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] or Navy [[Vice admiral (United States)|vice admiral]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[[Title 10 of the United States Code|10 U.S.C]] [http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C5.txt §155]</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

[[File:Joint Chiefs of Staff (December 2001).jpg|left|thumb|325px|The Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon in December 2001.]]
After the 1986 reorganization of the military undertaken by the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]], the Joint Chiefs of Staff does not have operational command of U.S. military forces. Responsibility for conducting military operations goes from the [[President of the United States of America|President]] to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] directly to the commanders of the [[Unified Combatant Command]]s and thus bypasses the Joint Chiefs of Staff completely.

Today, their primary responsibility is to ensure the personnel readiness, policy, planning and training of their respective military services for the combatant commanders to utilize. The Joint Chiefs of Staff also act in a military advisory capacity for the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense. In addition, the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] acts as the chief military advisor to the President and the Secretary of Defense. In this strictly advisory role, the Joint Chiefs constitute the second-highest deliberatory body for military policy, after the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], which includes the President and other officials besides the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

While serving as chairman or Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Chief of Staff of the Army, Chief of Naval Operations, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Commandant of the Marine Corps, or Commandant of the Coast Guard, the salary is $20,263.50 a month, regardless of cumulative years of service computed under section 205 of title 37, United States Code.

'''Notes:'''
* The Joint Chiefs do not include the [[Commandant of the Coast Guard]] because the Coast Guard is normally under the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], where the other four branches are under the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. However, the Coast Guard is always a military service (14 United States Code, section 1) and may operate under the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] during wartime. The commandant of the Coast Guard is however, occasionally invited by the chairman to attend meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://nation.time.com/2012/01/04/the-changing-of-the-guard/ The Changing of the Guard]</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="2" i="3">==History==</h>

<h level="3" i="4">===Joint Board===</h>
As the [[military of the United States]] grew in size following the [[American Civil War]], joint military action between the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] became increasingly difficult. The Army and Navy were unsupportive of each other at either the planning or operational level and were constrained by disagreements during the [[Spanish–American War]] in the [[Caribbean]] campaigns.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Millett&quot;</attr><inner>Allan R. Millett, ''Semper Fidelis: The History of the United States Marine Corps'', 1980;pg. 269, para. 2.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The Joint Army and Navy Board was established in 1903 by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], comprising representatives from the military heads and chief planners of both the Navy's [[General Board]] and the Army's [[General Staff]]. The Joint Board acting as an &quot;advisory committee&quot; was created to plan joint operations and resolve problems of common [[interservice rivalry|rivalry]] between the two services.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Millett&quot;</attr></ext>

Yet, the Joint Board accomplished little as its charter gave it no authority to enforce its decisions. The Joint Board also lacked the ability to originate its own opinions and was thus limited to commenting only on the problems submitted to it by the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretaries of War]] and [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy]]. As a result, the Joint Board had little to no impact on the manner the United States conducted World War I.

After World War I, in 1919 the two Secretaries agreed to reestablish and revitalize the Joint Board. The mission of the General staff was to develop plans for mobilization for the next war; the US was always designated &quot;Blue&quot; and [[United States color-coded war plans|potential enemies were assigned various other colors]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>'''p26''' John H. Bradley, Thomas E. Griess, Jack W. Dice, [[United States Military Academy]], Dept. of History: ''The Second World War: Asia and the Pacific'' Square One Publishers, Inc., 2002</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

This time, the Joint Board's membership would include the Chiefs of Staff, their deputies, and the Chief of [[War Plans Division]] for the Army and Director of Plans Division for the Navy. Under the Joint Board would be a staff called the Joint Planning Committee to serve the Board. Along with new membership, the Joint Board could initiate recommendations on its own initiative. However, the Joint Board still did not possess the legal authority to enforce its decisions.

<h level="3" i="5">===World War II===</h>

The UK portion of the CCS would be composed of the British [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]], but the United States had no equivalent body. The Joint Board's lack of authority made it of little use to the CCS, although its 1935 publication, Joint Action of the Army and Navy, did give some guidance for the joint operations during World War II. The Joint Board had little influence during the war and was ultimately disbanded in 1947.

As a counterpart to the UK's Chiefs of Staff Committee in the CCS, and to provide better coordinated effort and coordinated staff work for America's military effort, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William D. Leahy]] proposed a &quot;unified high command&quot; in what would come to be called the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Modeled on the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, the JCS' first formal meeting was held on 9 February 1942, to coordinate U.S. military operations between War and Navy Departments.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> Name=WCP </attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book |title=United States Army in World War II – The War Department – Global Logistics and Strategy 1940–1943 |last=Leighton |first=Richard M. |author2=Robert W Coakley |year=1995 |publisher=Center of Military History, United States Army, Washington, D.

As the table indicates, each of the members of the original Joint Chiefs was a four-star flag officer in his respective service branch. By the end of the war, however, each had been promoted: Leahy and King to [[Fleet Admiral]]; Marshall and Arnold to [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]]. Arnold was later appointed to the grade of [[General of the Air Force (United States)|General of the Air Force]].

One of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's committees was the Joint Strategic Survey Committee (JSSC). The JSSC was an extraordinary JCS committee that existed from 1942 until 1947. It was &quot;one of the most influential planning agencies in the wartime armed forces.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Mark. A.

[[File:US Joint Chiefs of Staff Jul 1983.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Joint Chiefs of Staff and several Commanders in Chief gathered at the Pentagon on 1 July 1983.]]
With the end of World War II, the Joint Chiefs of Staff was officially established under the [[National Security Act of 1947]]. Per the National Security Act, the JCS consisted of a chairman, the [[Chief of Staff of the Army]], the [[Chief of Staff of the Air Force]] (which was established as a separate service by the same Act), and the [[Chief of Naval Operations]]. The [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] was to be consulted on matters concerning the Corps, but was not a regular member; General [[Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr.]], Commandant in 1952–55, was the first to sit as an occasional member. The law was amended during the term of General [[Louis H. Wilson, Jr.]] (1975–79), making the Commandant a full-time JCS member in parity with the other three DoD services.

The position of vice-chairman was created by the [[Goldwater–Nichols Act]] of 1986 to complement the CJCS, as well as to delegate some of the chairman's responsibilities, particularly resource allocation through the [[Joint Requirements Oversight Council]] (JROC).

General [[Colin Powell|Colin L. Powell]] (1989–93) was the first and, as of 2011, the only African American to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General [[Peter Pace]] (Vice chairman 2001–05; Chairman, 2005–07) was the first Marine to serve in either position. No woman has ever served on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

The current chairman is [[General (United States)|General]] Martin E. Dempsey, [[United States Army|USA]], who began his term on 1 October 2011.

On 20 July 1942, Navy [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[William D. Leahy]] became the Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy (20 July 1942 – 21 March 1949). He was not technically the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Leahy's office was the precursor to the post of ''Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff''. That post was established and first held by General of the Army [[Omar Bradley]] in 1949.

The position of [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] was created by the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]] of 1986. The vice-chairman is a four-star-[[General (United States)|general]] or [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] and, by law, is the second highest-ranking member of the U.S. Armed Forces (after the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]). In the absence of the chairman, the vice-chairman presides over the meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He may also perform such duties as the chairman may prescribe. It was not until the National Defense Authorization Act in 1992 that the position was made a full voting member of the JCS.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://www.jcs.mil/about_cjs.html About the Joint Chiefs]</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

It was to be a newly created position established to advise the chairman on all matters involving enlisted personnel in a joint environment.

The [[Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman]] of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is currently Sergeant Major [[Bryan B. Battaglia]], [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]]. Battaglia was sworn in by Joint Chiefs chairman Gen.

<h level="2" i="15">==Coast Guard==</h>
Although the Coast Guard is one of the five armed services of the United States, the [[Commandant of the Coast Guard]] is not a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is, however, entitled to the same supplemental pay as the Joint Chiefs, per 37 U.S.C. § 414(a)(5) ($4,000 per annum in 2009), and is accorded [[Floor privileges of the United States Senate|privilege of the floor]] under Senate Rule XXIII(1) as a ''de facto'' JCS member during Presidential addresses. In contrast to the Joint Chiefs—who are not in the military's operational chain of command—the Commandant of the Coast Guard commands his service. Coast Guard officers are legally eligible to be appointed as CJCS and VCJCS, per 10 U.S.C. 152(a)(1) &amp; 154(a)(1) respectively—which use the collective term &quot;armed forces&quot; rather than listing the eligible services—but none has been appointed to either position as of 2014.
