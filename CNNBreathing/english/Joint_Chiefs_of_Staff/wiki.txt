The '''Joint Chiefs of Staff''' ('''JCS''') is a body of senior uniformed leaders in the [[United States Department of Defense]] who advise the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], the [[United States Homeland Security Council|Homeland Security Council]], the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] and the [[President of the United States]] on military matters. The composition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is defined by statute and consists of the ''[[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]'' (''CJCS''), ''[[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]'' (''VCJCS''), and the Military Service Chiefs from <!-- Comment: the Army Navy, USAF, and USMC--the USCG is not an "armed force" except in time of war when subordinated to the SecDef; ref ramains TITLE 10 > Subtitle A > PART I > CHAPTER 5 > § 151, para (a)(6)~~~~-->the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army]], [[Chief of Naval Operations|Navy]], [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Air Force]], the [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], and the [[Chief of the National Guard Bureau]],<ref name="armytimes">{{cite news |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2012/01/army-air-force-top-guard-officer-joins-joint-chiefs-010412w/ |title=Top Guard officer joins Joint Chiefs of Staff |work=Army Times |date=4 January 2012}}</ref> all appointed by the President following [[United States Senate|Senate]] confirmation.<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000151----000-.html] 10 USC 151.

Following the [[Goldwater–Nichols Act]] in 1986, the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not have operational command authority, neither individually nor collectively, as the chain of command goes from the President to the Secretary of Defense, and from the Secretary of Defense to the [[Unified Combatant Command|Commanders of the Combatant Commands]].<ref>[[Title 10 of the United States Code|10 U.S.C.]] [http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C6.txt §162(b)]</ref> Goldwater–Nichols also created the office of Vice Chairman, and the Chairman is now designated as the ''principal military adviser'' to the Secretary of Defense, the Homeland Security Council, the National Security Council and to the President.<ref>[[Title 10 of the United States Code|10 U.S.C]] [http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C5.txt §151(b)]</ref>

The '''Joint Staff''' ('''JS''') is a headquarters staff in the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], composed of personnel from each of the four Department of Defense armed services, that assists the Chairman and the Vice Chairman in discharging their responsibilities and is managed by the ''[[Director of the Joint Staff]]'' (''DJS'') who is a [[Lieutenant general (United States)|lieutenant general]] or Navy [[Vice admiral (United States)|vice admiral]].<ref>[[Title 10 of the United States Code|10 U.S.C]] [http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/10C5.txt §155]</ref>

==Role and responsibilities==
[[File:Joint Chiefs of Staff (December 2001).jpg|left|thumb|325px|The Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon in December 2001.]]
After the 1986 reorganization of the military undertaken by the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]], the Joint Chiefs of Staff does not have operational command of U.S. military forces. Responsibility for conducting military operations goes from the [[President of the United States of America|President]] to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] directly to the commanders of the [[Unified Combatant Command]]s and thus bypasses the Joint Chiefs of Staff completely.

Today, their primary responsibility is to ensure the personnel readiness, policy, planning and training of their respective military services for the combatant commanders to utilize. The Joint Chiefs of Staff also act in a military advisory capacity for the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense. In addition, the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] acts as the chief military advisor to the President and the Secretary of Defense. In this strictly advisory role, the Joint Chiefs constitute the second-highest deliberatory body for military policy, after the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], which includes the President and other officials besides the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

While serving as chairman or Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Chief of Staff of the Army, Chief of Naval Operations, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Commandant of the Marine Corps, or Commandant of the Coast Guard, the salary is $20,263.50 a month, regardless of cumulative years of service computed under section 205 of title 37, United States Code.

'''Notes:'''
* The Joint Chiefs do not include the [[Commandant of the Coast Guard]] because the Coast Guard is normally under the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]], where the other four branches are under the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. However, the Coast Guard is always a military service (14 United States Code, section 1) and may operate under the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]] during wartime. The commandant of the Coast Guard is however, occasionally invited by the chairman to attend meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.<ref>[http://nation.time.com/2012/01/04/the-changing-of-the-guard/ The Changing of the Guard]</ref>

==History==

===Joint Board===
As the [[military of the United States]] grew in size following the [[American Civil War]], joint military action between the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] became increasingly difficult. The Army and Navy were unsupportive of each other at either the planning or operational level and were constrained by disagreements during the [[Spanish–American War]] in the [[Caribbean]] campaigns.<ref name="Millett">Allan R. Millett, ''Semper Fidelis: The History of the United States Marine Corps'', 1980;pg. 269, para. 2.</ref> The Joint Army and Navy Board was established in 1903 by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], comprising representatives from the military heads and chief planners of both the Navy's [[General Board]] and the Army's [[General Staff]]. The Joint Board acting as an "advisory committee" was created to plan joint operations and resolve problems of common [[interservice rivalry|rivalry]] between the two services.<ref name="Millett"/>

Yet, the Joint Board accomplished little as its charter gave it no authority to enforce its decisions. The Joint Board also lacked the ability to originate its own opinions and was thus limited to commenting only on the problems submitted to it by the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretaries of War]] and [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Navy]]. As a result, the Joint Board had little to no impact on the manner the United States conducted World War I.

After World War I, in 1919 the two Secretaries agreed to reestablish and revitalize the Joint Board. The mission of the General staff was to develop plans for mobilization for the next war; the US was always designated "Blue" and [[United States color-coded war plans|potential enemies were assigned various other colors]].<ref>'''p26''' John H. Bradley, Thomas E. Griess, Jack W. Dice, [[United States Military Academy]], Dept. of History: ''The Second World War: Asia and the Pacific'' Square One Publishers, Inc., 2002</ref>

This time, the Joint Board's membership would include the Chiefs of Staff, their deputies, and the Chief of [[War Plans Division]] for the Army and Director of Plans Division for the Navy. Under the Joint Board would be a staff called the Joint Planning Committee to serve the Board. Along with new membership, the Joint Board could initiate recommendations on its own initiative. However, the Joint Board still did not possess the legal authority to enforce its decisions.

===World War II===
[[File:World War II Joint Chiefs of Staff 1943.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting (circa 1943). From left to right are: Gen. [[Henry H. Arnold]], Chief of Staff, [[U.S. Army Air Forces]]; Adm. [[William D. Leahy]], Chair, Joint Chiefs of Staff; Adm. [[Ernest J. King]], Chief of Naval Operations and Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet; and Gen. [[George C. Marshall]], Chief of Staff of the Army.]]
President of the United States [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom [[Winston Churchill]] established the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]] (CCS) during the 1942 [[Arcadia Conference]].<ref Name=WCP>{{cite book |title=United States Army in World War II – The War Department – Washington Command Post: The Operations Division; Chapter VI. Organizing The High Command For World War II "Development of the Joint and Combined Chiefs of Staff System" |last=Cline |first=Ray S. |year=1990 |publisher=Center of Military History, United States Army, Washington, D. C. |pages=98–104 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/WCP/ChapterVI.htm#p98 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> The CCS would serve as the supreme military body for strategic direction of the combined US-[[Commonwealth of Nations|British Empire]] war effort.

The UK portion of the CCS would be composed of the British [[Chiefs of Staff Committee]], but the United States had no equivalent body. The Joint Board's lack of authority made it of little use to the CCS, although its 1935 publication, Joint Action of the Army and Navy, did give some guidance for the joint operations during World War II. The Joint Board had little influence during the war and was ultimately disbanded in 1947.

As a counterpart to the UK's Chiefs of Staff Committee in the CCS, and to provide better coordinated effort and coordinated staff work for America's military effort, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[William D. Leahy]] proposed a "unified high command" in what would come to be called the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Modeled on the British Chiefs of Staff Committee, the JCS' first formal meeting was held on 9 February 1942, to coordinate U.S. military operations between War and Navy Departments.<ref Name=WCP /><ref>{{cite book |title=United States Army in World War II – The War Department – Global Logistics and Strategy 1940–1943 |last=Leighton |first=Richard M. |author2=Robert W Coakley |year=1995 |publisher=Center of Military History, United States Army, Washington, D. C. |page=144 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/books/001/1-5/index.html |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref> On 20 July 1942, Admiral Leahy became the '''[[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy]]''' ("''Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States''" is the military title of the U.S. President, per Article II, § 2, of the Constitution), with the chiefs of staff of the services serving under his leadership.

The first members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were:<ref name="life1942100595">{{cite news |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UUAEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA2&pg=PA95#v=onepage&f=true |title=Washington Eats |work=Life |date=5 October 1942 |accessdate=20 November 2011 |page=95}}</ref>

As the table indicates, each of the members of the original Joint Chiefs was a four-star flag officer in his respective service branch. By the end of the war, however, each had been promoted: Leahy and King to [[Fleet Admiral]]; Marshall and Arnold to [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]]. Arnold was later appointed to the grade of [[General of the Air Force (United States)|General of the Air Force]].

One of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's committees was the Joint Strategic Survey Committee (JSSC). The JSSC was an extraordinary JCS committee that existed from 1942 until 1947. It was "one of the most influential planning agencies in the wartime armed forces."<ref>Mark. A. Stoler, "From Continentalism to Globalism: General Stanley D. Embick, the Joint Strategic Survey Committee, and the Military View of American National Policy during the Second World War," ''Diplomatic History'', vol. 6, no. 3 (July 1982), pp. 303—320, quote at p. 307</ref> Members included Lieutenant General [[Stanley D. Embick]], U.S. Army, chairman, 1942–, Vice Admiral [[Russell Willson]], U.S. Navy, 1942–1945, Vice Admiral [[Theodore Stark Wilkinson]], U.S. Navy, 1946, and Major General [[Muir S. Fairchild]], U.S. Army Air Force, 1942–.

===National Security Act of 1947===
[[File:US Joint Chiefs of Staff Jul 1983.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Joint Chiefs of Staff and several Commanders in Chief gathered at the Pentagon on 1 July 1983.]]
With the end of World War II, the Joint Chiefs of Staff was officially established under the [[National Security Act of 1947]]. Per the National Security Act, the JCS consisted of a chairman, the [[Chief of Staff of the Army]], the [[Chief of Staff of the Air Force]] (which was established as a separate service by the same Act), and the [[Chief of Naval Operations]]. The [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]] was to be consulted on matters concerning the Corps, but was not a regular member; General [[Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr.]], Commandant in 1952–55, was the first to sit as an occasional member. The law was amended during the term of General [[Louis H. Wilson, Jr.]] (1975–79), making the Commandant a full-time JCS member in parity with the other three DoD services.

The position of vice-chairman was created by the [[Goldwater–Nichols Act]] of 1986 to complement the CJCS, as well as to delegate some of the chairman's responsibilities, particularly resource allocation through the [[Joint Requirements Oversight Council]] (JROC).

General [[Colin Powell|Colin L. Powell]] (1989–93) was the first and, as of 2011, the only African American to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General [[Peter Pace]] (Vice chairman 2001–05; Chairman, 2005–07) was the first Marine to serve in either position. No woman has ever served on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

===National Defense Authorization Act of 2012===
A provision in the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act added the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Guard historians called it the "most significant development" for the National Guard since the [[Militia Act of 1903]].<ref name="armytimes"/>

==Organization and leadership positions==

===Chairman===
<!-- This section is linked from [[Colin Powell]] -->
{{Main|Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff}}

The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is, by law, the highest-ranking military officer of the [[United States Armed Forces]],<ref name="CJCS">[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000152----000-.html] 10 USC 152. Chairman: appointment; grade and rank</ref> and the principal military adviser to the President of the United States. He leads the meetings and coordinates the efforts of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, comprising the chairman, the [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], the Chiefs of Staff of the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|United States Army]] and [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|United States Air Force]], the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], and the [[Commandant of the United States Marine Corps]]. The Joint Chiefs of Staff have offices in [[The Pentagon]]. The chairman outranks all respective heads of each service branch,<ref name="head">[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000152----000-.html#c] 10 USC 152(c). Chairman: appointment; grade and rank – Grade and Rank.</ref> but does not have command authority over them, their service branches or the [[Unified Combatant Command]]s.<ref name="head"/> All combatant commanders receive operational orders directly from the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].<ref>[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode10/usc_sec_10_00000162----000-.html] 10 USC 162. Combatant commands: assigned forces; chain of command</ref>

The current chairman is [[General (United States)|General]] Martin E. Dempsey, [[United States Army|USA]], who began his term on 1 October 2011.

On 20 July 1942, Navy [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]] [[William D. Leahy]] became the Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy (20 July 1942 – 21 March 1949). He was not technically the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Leahy's office was the precursor to the post of ''Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff''. That post was established and first held by General of the Army [[Omar Bradley]] in 1949.

===Vice Chairman===
{{Main|Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff}}

The position of [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] was created by the [[Goldwater-Nichols Act]] of 1986. The vice-chairman is a four-star-[[General (United States)|general]] or [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] and, by law, is the second highest-ranking member of the U.S. Armed Forces (after the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]). In the absence of the chairman, the vice-chairman presides over the meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He may also perform such duties as the chairman may prescribe. It was not until the National Defense Authorization Act in 1992 that the position was made a full voting member of the JCS.<ref>[http://www.jcs.mil/about_cjs.html About the Joint Chiefs]</ref>

The current vice-chairman is General [[Paul J. Selva]], [[United States Air Force|USAF]].

===Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman===
{{Main|Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman}}
Command Sergeant Major [[William Gainey|William J. Gainey]], USA, was selected to serve as the first [[Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman]] of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (SEAC) beginning 1 Oct 2005. It was to be a newly created position established to advise the chairman on all matters involving enlisted personnel in a joint environment.

The [[Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman]] of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is currently Sergeant Major [[Bryan B. Battaglia]], [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]]. Battaglia was sworn in by Joint Chiefs chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey on 30 September 2011 in a ceremony at [[Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall]], [[Virginia]].<ref>[http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=65514 News Article: Battaglia Takes Oath as Chairman’s Enlisted Advisor]. Defense.gov. Retrieved on 2013-07-21.</ref> The position had been vacant since CSM Gainey's retirement on 25 April 2008.

As the SEA to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the SEAC is an advisor to the chairman on all matters concerning joint and combined total force integration, utilization, and development. Additionally, the SEAC helps develop noncommissioned officers (NCOs)-related joint professional education, enhance utilization of senior NCOs on joint battle staffs, and support the chairman’s responsibilities as directed.

[[File:US Joint Chiefs of Staff Nov 1989.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Joint Chiefs of Staff (seated) and the directors of the Joint Staff directorates (standing), November 1989.]]
The Joint Staff (JS) is a military headquarters staff based at the [[Pentagon building|Pentagon]], composed of personnel from all the four DoD services, assisting the Chairman and the Vice Chairman in discharging their responsibilities. They work closely with the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]] (OSD), the Military Department staffs, and the [[Combatant Command]] Staffs.

The [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] is assisted by the [[Director of the Joint Staff]], a three-star officer who assists the chairman with the management of the Joint Staff, an organization composed of approximately equal numbers of officers contributed by the Army, the Navy and Marine Corps, and the Air Force, who have been assigned to assist the chairman in providing to the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] unified strategic direction, operation, and integration of the combatant land, naval, and air forces.

===Directorates of the Joint Staff===
The Joint Staff includes the following departments where all the planning, policies, [[intelligence]], [[Human resources|manpower]], communications and logistics functions are translated into action.<ref>[http://www.jcs.mil/j3/index.html jcs.mil]</ref>

* CJCS Joint Distinguished Civilian Service Award
* CJCS Joint Meritorious Civilian Service Award
* Joint Civilian Service Commendation Award (JCSCA)
* Joint Civilian Service Achievement Award (JCSAA)

==Coast Guard==
Although the Coast Guard is one of the five armed services of the United States, the [[Commandant of the Coast Guard]] is not a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He is, however, entitled to the same supplemental pay as the Joint Chiefs, per 37 U.S.C. § 414(a)(5) ($4,000 per annum in 2009), and is accorded [[Floor privileges of the United States Senate|privilege of the floor]] under Senate Rule XXIII(1) as a ''de facto'' JCS member during Presidential addresses. In contrast to the Joint Chiefs—who are not in the military's operational chain of command—the Commandant of the Coast Guard commands his service. Coast Guard officers are legally eligible to be appointed as CJCS and VCJCS, per 10 U.S.C. 152(a)(1) & 154(a)(1) respectively—which use the collective term "armed forces" rather than listing the eligible services—but none has been appointed to either position as of 2014.
