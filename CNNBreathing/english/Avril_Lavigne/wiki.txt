The family moved to [[Napanee, Ontario]], when Lavigne was five years old.

In 1998, Lavigne won a competition to sing with fellow Canadian singer [[Shania Twain]] on her first major concert tour. She appeared alongside Twain at her concert in [[Ottawa]], appearing on stage to sing "[[What Made You Say That]]". She was discovered by her first professional manager, Cliff Fabri, while singing [[country music|country]] covers at a [[Chapters]] bookstore in [[Kingston, Ontario]].<ref name=unofficialbiog/> During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folk singer Steve Medd; he invited her to contribute vocals on his song, "Touch the Sky", for his 1999 album, ''Quinte Spirit''. She later sang on "Temple of Life" and "Two Rivers" for his follow-up 2000 album, ''My Window to You''.<ref name=unofficialbiog/>

==Music career==
In November 2000,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/l/lavigne_avril/news_feature_071202/index.jhtml|title=Avril Lavigne: The Real Deal|last=Pak|first=SuChin|coauthors=D'Angelo, Joe|publisher=MTV|accessdate=14 March 2009}}</ref>{{fv|date=May 2010}} Ken Krongard, an [[A&R]] representative, invited [[L. A. Reid|Antonio "L.A." Reid]], the head of [[Arista Records]], to hear Lavigne sing for 15 minutes at producer [[Peter Zizzo]]'s Manhattan studio. Lavigne so impressed Reid, he immediately signed her to Arista with a deal worth $1.25 million for two albums and an extra $900,000 for a publishing advance.<ref name=unofficialbiog/><ref name=WillmanAnti>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,384096,00.html|title=Avril Lavigne The Anti-Britney|last=Willman|first=Chris|date=1 November 2002|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=14 March 2009}}</ref> Signed as a singer, Lavigne was pitched with songs written by others. She dismissed them, however, and insisted on writing music herself. For a year, Lavigne and Arista had conflicts in musical direction. She collaborated with the music production team [[The Matrix (record production team)|The Matrix]], and the ensuing album became  ''Let Go''.<ref name=rollingstoneeliscu>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/avril_lavigne_five_feet_one/page|title=Little Miss Can't Be Wrong|last=Eliscu|first=Jenny|date=20 March 2003|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=16 March 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref>

While Lavigne was in the studio for her third studio album, [[Fox Entertainment Group]] approached her to write a song for the soundtrack to the 2006 fantasy-adventure film ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]''.

===Fourth studio album===
Only a month after completing ''The Best Damn Tour'', Lavigne began recording in her home studio in November 2008 with "Black Star".<ref name=musicmix/> To help promote her first fragrance, Black Star, Lavigne needed a short theme that would be used for the [[TV spots]]. "Black Star" was composed in a [[Malaysia|Malaysian]] hotel during her tour. The [[jingle]] was eventually expanded into a full song, which ''Rolling Stone'' described as "an ethereal lullaby that turns epic with tinkling [[Coldplay]]-like pianos and soaring strings."<ref name=rollingstoneblackstar/>
{{Rquote|right|I always had material, but some people that I worked with didn’t really care, because they wanted to write the stuff.|Avril Lavigne|''Entertainment Weekly''<ref name=musicmix/>}}
Recording began with minimal instruments, usually starting with Lavigne singing only to acoustic guitar, with additional instruments added later. Lavigne described the process: "It’s stripped down. I love performing that way, so I really felt like it was time to make a record like that. To just make it all about the vocal and the performance, and the vibe, and the emotion." By July 2009, nine tracks had been recorded,<ref name=musicmix/> including the songs "Fine", "Everybody Hurts" and "Darlin". Several of the tracks were written in Lavigne's youth. "Darlin" was the second song Lavigne wrote as a 15-year-old while living in Napanee, Ontario. Lavigne described the album as being about "life". She stated, "It's so easy for me to do a boy-bashing pop song, but to sit down and write honestly about something that's really close to me, something I've been through, it's a totally different thing."

The album is expected to be a return to Lavigne's older musical style and may be largely [[acoustic music|acoustic]],<ref name=guardian/> which would suit her desire to support the album in smaller venues. Lavigne said, "[For] this record, I just really, really wanted to sing. [...] I just wanna have silence around me, and have these acoustic songs and really deliver."

The album's and lead single's release dates have been pushed back several times. The album was originally scheduled for release on 17 November 2009.<ref name=musicmix/> Later, in January 2010, Lavigne stated that the album cover had been photographed and the first single would be released in April, followed by the album in June.<ref name=seacrestinterview26/> In May, Lavigne admitted that she considered the album too serious and "mellow" and would return to the studio to balance the album out. "With an album, I don't want to rush it out. [...] I have a very serious record, so I think I need to put a couple upbeat, fun songs on it."<ref name=seacrestinterview6may/>

In January, while simultaneously writing and recording for her new album, Lavigne was working with [[Disney]] on ''Alice in Wonderland''-themed clothing designs, inspired by [[Tim Burton]]'s feature film, ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. She asked the executives if she could write a song for the film. The result was the song "[[Alice (Avril Lavigne song)|Alice]]",<ref name=seacrestinterview26/> which was played over the end credits<ref name=pacifican/> and included on the soundtrack, ''[[Almost Alice]]''.<ref name=earthtimes/>

On 28 February, Lavigne gave a performance at the concert portion of the [[2010 Winter Olympics closing ceremony]], performing "My Happy Ending" and "Girlfriend".<ref name=merinews/>
