While Lavigne was in the studio for her third studio album, [[Fox Entertainment Group]] approached her to write a song for the soundtrack to the 2006 fantasy-adventure film ''[[Eragon (film)|Eragon]]''. She wrote and recorded two &quot;ballad-type&quot; songs, but only one, &quot;[[Keep Holding On]]&quot;, ended up being used for the film.

<h level="3" i="6">===Fourth studio album===</h>
Only a month after completing ''The Best Damn Tour'', Lavigne began recording in her home studio in November 2008 with &quot;Black Star&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=musicmix</attr></ext> To help promote her first fragrance, Black Star, Lavigne needed a short theme that would be used for the [[TV spots]]. &quot;Black Star&quot; was composed in a [[Malaysia|Malaysian]] hotel during her tour. The [[jingle]] was eventually expanded into a full song, which ''Rolling Stone'' described as &quot;an ethereal lullaby that turns epic with tinkling [[Coldplay]]-like pianos and soaring strings.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=rollingstoneblackstar</attr></ext>
<template lineStart="1"><title>Rquote</title><part><name index="1"/><value>right</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>I always had material, but some people that I worked with didn’t really care, because they wanted to write the stuff.</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>Avril Lavigne</value></part><part><name index="4"/><value>''Entertainment Weekly''<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=musicmix</attr></ext></value></part></template>
Recording began with minimal instruments, usually starting with Lavigne singing only to acoustic guitar, with additional instruments added later. Lavigne described the process: &quot;It’s stripped down. I love performing that way, so I really felt like it was time to make a record like that. To just make it all about the vocal and the performance, and the vibe, and the emotion.&quot; By July 2009, nine tracks had been recorded,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=musicmix</attr></ext> including the songs &quot;Fine&quot;, &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; and &quot;Darlin&quot;. Several of the tracks were written in Lavigne's youth. &quot;Darlin&quot; was the second song Lavigne wrote as a 15-year-old while living in Napanee, Ontario. Lavigne described the album as being about &quot;life&quot;. She stated, &quot;It's so easy for me to do a boy-bashing pop song, but to sit down and write honestly about something that's really close to me, something I've been through, it's a totally different thing.&quot;

The album is expected to be a return to Lavigne's older musical style and may be largely [[acoustic music|acoustic]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=guardian</attr></ext> which would suit her desire to support the album in smaller venues. Lavigne said, &quot;[For] this record, I just really, really wanted to sing. [...] I just wanna have silence around me, and have these acoustic songs and really deliver.&quot;

The album's and lead single's release dates have been pushed back several times. The album was originally scheduled for release on 17 November 2009.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=musicmix</attr></ext> Later, in January 2010, Lavigne stated that the album cover had been photographed and the first single would be released in April, followed by the album in June.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=seacrestinterview26</attr></ext> In May, Lavigne admitted that she considered the album too serious and &quot;mellow&quot; and would return to the studio to balance the album out. &quot;With an album, I don't want to rush it out. [...] I have a very serious record, so I think I need to put a couple upbeat, fun songs on it.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=seacrestinterview6may</attr></ext>

In January, while simultaneously writing and recording for her new album, Lavigne was working with [[Disney]] on ''Alice in Wonderland''-themed clothing designs, inspired by [[Tim Burton]]'s feature film, ''[[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]''. She asked the executives if she could write a song for the film. The result was the song &quot;[[Alice (Avril Lavigne song)|Alice]]&quot;,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=seacrestinterview26</attr></ext> which was played over the end credits<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=pacifican</attr></ext> and included on the soundtrack, ''[[Almost Alice]]''.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=earthtimes</attr></ext>
