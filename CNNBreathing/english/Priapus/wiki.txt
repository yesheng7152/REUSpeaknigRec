In [[Greek mythology]], '''Priapos''' ({{lang-grc|Πρίαπος}}) Latinized as '''Priapus''' was a minor rustic fertility god, protector of [[livestock]], fruit plants, gardens and male  [[genitalia]]. His [[Roman mythology|Roman]] equivalent was '''Mutinus Mutunus'''. He was best noted for his huge, permanent [[erection]], which gave rise to the medical term [[priapism]].

==Relationship with other deities==

He was described as the son of [[Aphrodite]] by [[Dionysus]], perhaps as father or son of  [[Hermes]],<ref>Kerenyi, ''Gods of the Greeks'', 1951, p. 175, noting G. Kaibel, ''Epigrammata graeca ex lapidibus collecta'', 817, where the other god's name, both father and son of Hermes, is obscured; [[Hyginus]] (''Fabula'' 160) makes Hermes the father of Pan.</ref> son of [[Zeus]] or [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], depending on the source.<ref>"Priapus". ''The Oxford Companion to World Mythology''. David Leeming. Oxford University Press, 2004.</ref> According to legend, [[Hera]] cursed him with impotence, ugliness and foul-mindedness while he was still in Aphrodite's womb, in revenge for the hero [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] having the temerity to judge Aphrodite more beautiful than Hera.<ref>An elaboration on a ''[[scholium]]'' on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]' ''Argonautica'' i. Kereny remarks of the jealousy of Hera in this case, "a cheap theme, and certainly not an ancient one" (Kerenyi 1951, p.176).</ref> The other gods refused to allow him to live on [[Mount Olympus]] and threw him down to Earth, leaving him on a hillside. He was eventually found by shepherds and was brought up by them.

Priapus joined Pan and the [[satyr]]s as a spirit of fertility and growth, though he was perennially frustrated by his impotence. In a ribald anecdote told by Ovid,<ref>Ovid, ''[[Fasti]]'', vi.319ff</ref> he attempted to rape the nymph [[Lotis (mythology)|Lotis]] but was thwarted by an [[donkey|ass]], whose braying caused him to lose his erection at the critical moment and woke Lotis. He pursued the nymph until the gods took pity on her and turned her into a [[lotus tree|lotus]] plant. The episode gave him a lasting hatred of asses and a willingness to see them destroyed in his honour.<ref>"Priapus." ''Who's Who in Classical Mythology'', Routledge. 2002.</ref>The emblem of his lustful nature was his permanent [[erection]] and his giant penis.<ref name="bloomsbury">"Priapus." ''Bloomsbury Dictionary of Myth''. 1996.</ref>

==Worship and attributes==
[[File:Pompeya erótica5.jpg|right|thumb|Priapus depicted with the attributes of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] in a fresco found at Pompeii]]
The first extant mention of Priapus is in the eponymous comedy ''Priapus'', written in the fourth century BC by [[Xenarchus]]. Originally worshipped by Greek colonists in [[Lampsacus]] in [[Asia Minor]], the cult of Priapus spread to mainland Greece and eventually to Italy during the third century BC.<ref name="ocd">Robert Christopher Towneley Parker. "Priapus". ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary.'' Ed. Simon Hornblower and Anthony Spawforth. Oxford University Press 2003.</ref> [[Lucian]] (''De saltatione'') tells that in [[Bithynia]] Priapus was accounted as a warlike god, a rustic tutor to the infant [[Ares]], "who taught him dancing first and war only afterwards," Karl Kerenyi observed.<ref>Kerenyi, ''Gods of the Greeks'', 1951, p. 154, also pp.  175-77. .</ref> [[Arnobius]] is aware of the importance accorded Priapus in this region near the [[Hellespont]].<ref>In ridiculing the literal aspects of pagan gods given human form, he mentions "the Hellespontian Priapus bearing about among the goddesses, virgin and matron, those parts ever prepared for encounter." (Arnobius, ''Seven Books against the Heathen'' III.10 ([http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1008/_P3.HTM on-line text]).</ref> Also, Pausanias notes:
:This god is worshipped where goats and sheep pasture or there are swarms of bees; but by the people of Lampsacus he is more revered than any other god, being called by them a son of Dionysus and Aphrodite.<ref>Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' IX.312.</ref> 

Outside his "home" region in Asia Minor, Priapus was regarded as something of a joke by urban dwellers. However, he played a more important role in the countryside, where he was seen as a guardian deity. He was regarded as the patron god of sailors and fishermen and others in need of good luck, and his presence was believed to avert the [[evil eye]].<ref>"Priapus." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007</ref>

Priapus does not appear to have had an organised cult and was mostly worshipped in gardens or homes, though there are attestations of temples dedicated to the god. His sacrificial animal was the [[ass (animal)|ass]], reflecting his lustful nature, but agricultural offerings (such as fruit, flowers, vegetables and fish) were also very common.<ref name="ocd" />

Long after the fall of Rome and the rise of [[Christianity]], Priapus continued to be invoked as a symbol of health and fertility. The 13th century [[Lanercost Chronicle]], a history of northern England and Scotland, records a "lay [[Cistercian]] brother" erecting a statue of Priapus (''simulacrum Priapi statuere'') in a bid to end an outbreak of cattle disease.<ref>Yves Bonnefoy, ''Roman and European Mythologies'', pp. 139-142. University of Chicago Press, 1992. ISBN 0226064557</ref>

In the 1980s, D. F. Cassidy founded the [[St. Priapus Church]] as a modern church centred on worship of the [[phallus]].<ref>[[J. Gordon Melton]] (1996, 5th ed.). ''Encyclopedia of American Religions'' (Detroit, Mich.: Gale) ISBN 0810377144 p. 952.</ref><ref>Andy Nyberg, "St. Priapus Church: The Organized Religion", ''[[The Advocate]]'', Sep. 1983, pp. 35–37.</ref>{{Dubious|date=September 2009}}

==Depictions==

Priapus' iconic attribute was his [[priapism]] (permanently erect [[penis]]); he probably absorbed some pre-existing [[phallus|ithyphallic]] deities as his cult developed. He was represented in a variety of ways, most commonly as a misshapen gnome-like figure with an enormous erect phallus. Statues of Priapus were common in ancient Greece and Rome, standing in gardens or at doorways and crossroads. To propitiate Priapus, the traveller would stroke the statue's penis as he passed by. The [[Athens|Athenians]] often conflated Priapus with [[Hermes]], the god of boundaries, and depicted a hybrid deity with a winged helmet, sandals and huge erection.<ref name="bloomsbury" />

Statues of Priapus were often hung with signs bearing [[epigram]]s, collected in ''Priapeia'' ([[Priapus#In literature|treated below]]), which threatened [[sexual assault]] towards transgressors of the boundaries that he protected:

:{| cellpadding=15
| 
''Percidere, puer, moneo; futuere, puella;''
:''barbatum furem tertia poena manet.''
''Femina si furtum faciet mihi virve puerve,''
:''haec cunnum, caput hic praebeat, ille nates.''
''Per medios ibit pueros mediasque puellas''
:''mentula, barbatis non nisi summa petet.''
| 
I warn you, boy, you will be screwed; girl, you will be fucked; 
:a third penalty awaits the bearded thief.
If a woman steals from me, or a man, or a boy,
:let the first give me her cunt, the second his head, the third his buttocks.
My dick will go through the middle of boys and the middle of girls, 
:but with bearded men it will aim only for the top.<ref>Craig A. Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity'', p. 21. Oxford University Press US, 1999. ISBN 0195125053</ref>

Another example comes from the works of [[Martial]] (6.73):

:''Non rudis indocta fecit me falce colonus:''
::''Dispensatoris nobile cernis opus.''
:''Nam Caeretani cultor ditissimus agri''
::''Hos Hilarus colles et iuga laeta tenet.''
:''Adspice, quam certo videar non ligneus ore,''
::''Nec devota focis inguinis arma geram:''
:''Sed mihi perpetua nunquam moritura cupresso''
::''Phidiaci rigeat mentala digna manu.''
:''Vicini, moneo, sanctum celebrate Priapum,''
::''Et bis septenis parcite iugeribus.''

Blackwell Publishing, 2005. ISBN 0631232486</ref>}}

A number of Roman paintings of Priapus have survived. One of the most famous such images of Priapus is that from the [[House of the Vettii]] in [[Pompeii]]. A [[fresco]] depicts the god weighing his phallus against a bag full of money; it appears that his phallus is heavier. In nearby [[Herculaneum]], an excavated snack bar has a painting of Priapus behind the bar, apparently as a good-luck symbol for the customers.

==In literature==
{{Main|Priapeia}}
Priapus gave rise to a genre of poetry collectively termed ''Priapeia''. The genre shows how Roman poets in particular invented comic and obscene situations for the deity, giving him more literary prominence than he enjoyed in rites or cult, though masked phallic figures were prominent on many festive occasions, both in Greece and in the wider Roman world. 

In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti]]'',<ref>Fasti, 6.319ff.</ref> the [[nymph]] [[Lotis]] fell into a drunken slumber at a feast, and Priapus seized this opportunity to advance upon her.  With stealth he approached, and just before he could embrace her, [[Silenus]]'s donkey alerted the party with "raucous braying". Lotis awoke and pushed Priapus away, but her only true escape was to be transformed into the [[lotus tree]].  To punish the donkey for spoiling his opportunity, Priapus bludgeoned it to death with his gargantuan phallus. In later versions of the story, Lotis is replaced with the virginal goddess [[Hestia]].  Ovid's anecdote served to explain why donkeys were sacrificed to Priapus in the city of [[Lampsacus]] on the Hellespont, where he was worshipped among the offspring of [[Hermes]].<ref>[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 160.</ref>

Priapus is mentioned in Geoffrey Chaucer's [[The Merchant's Tale]], part of the [[Canterbury Tales]].
During a description of a garden that the protagonist, Januarie, creates, Priapus is invoked in his form as God of gardens:
<blockquote>
<poem>
''Ne Priapus ne myghte nat suffise,''
''Though he be God of gardyns, for to telle''
''The beautee of the gardyn and the welle,''
''That stood under a laurer alwey grene.'' <ref>G. Chaucer, ''The Merchant's Prologue and Tale'', (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2006), p63</ref>

Priapus might not suffice,
Though he be god of gardens, to tell
Of the beauty of the garden and the well
That stood under the laurel, always green.
</poem>
</blockquote>
Priapus serves to remind the reader, or listening audience, that Januarie's intentions are driven by lust and not love.

== Patron of merchant sailing ==

Priapus’ role as a patron god for merchant sailors in ancient Greece and Rome is that of a protector and navigational aide. Recent shipwreck evidence contains apotropaic items carried onboard by mariners in the forms of a terracotta phallus, wooden Priapus figure, and bronze sheath from a military ram. Coinciding with the use of wooden Priapic markers erected in areas of dangerous passage or particular landing areas for sailors, the function of Priapus is much more extensive than previously thought.<ref name=neilson>Neilson III, Harry R.  2002.  “A terracotta phallus from Pisa Ship E: more evidence for the Priapus deity as protector of Greek and Roman navigators.”  ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'' 31.2: 248-253.</ref>

Although Priapus is commonly associated with the failed attempts of rape against the nymphs Lotis and Vesta in Ovid’s comedy Fasti<ref>Fantham, Elaine.  1983.  “Sexual Comedy in Ovid’s Fasti: Sources and Motivation.” ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 87: 185.</ref> and the rather flippant treatment of the deity in urban settings, Priapus’ protection traits can be traced back to the importance placed on the phallus in ancient times (particularly his association with fertility and garden protection)<ref name=neilson/>.  In Greece, the phallus was thought of to have a mind of its own, animal-like, separate from the mind and control of the man.<ref>Csapo, Eric. 1997. "Riding the Phallus for Dionysus: Iconology, Ritual, and Gender-Role De/Construction." ''Phoenix'' 51.3/4: 260.</ref>  Represented in its erect form, the phallus was present in almost every aspect of daily life, reaffirming the male-dominant state of affairs in its overt presence.<ref>Keuls, Eva C. 1985. ''The Reign of the Phallus: Sexual Politics in Ancient Athens.''  University of California Press: Berkeley and Los Angeles: 4-5.</ref>  The phallus is also associated with “possession and territorial demarcation” in many cultures, attributing to Priapus’ other role as a navigational deity. <ref name=neilson/>

==Modern derivations==

===Medical terminology===
The medical condition [[priapism]] derives its name from Priapus, alluding to the god's permanently engorged penis.

===Natural history===
* The group of worm-like marine burrowing animals known as the [[Priapulida|Priapulidea]], literally "penis worms", also derives its name from Priapus.
* ''[[Mutinus caninus]]'', a woodland fungus, draws its first name from Priapus's Roman name, due to its phallic shape.

===Popular culture===
*It has been suggested by some scholars that the modern popular [[garden gnome]] is a descendant of Priapus. <ref>Peter D. Arnott, ''An Introduction to the Roman World.'' London: MacMillan, 1970; Judith Harris, ''Pompeii Awakened: A Story of Rediscovery.'' I.B.Tauris, 2007, p. 117. ISBN 1845112415. Hugh Lloyd-Jones, ''Greek in a Cold Climate.'' Rowman & Littlefield, 1991, p. 64. ISBN 0389209678.</ref>
*Due to his large and constantly erect phallus, Priapus is sometimes the subject of [[Penis joke|jokes]].
*The [[Marvel Comics]] series ''[[Terror Inc.]]'' featured a villain character, [[Priapus (Marvel Comics)|Priapus]], possibly based on the god.
