'''Anfield''' is a [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Anfield, Liverpool]], England which has a [[seating capacity]] of 45,276.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=capacity</attr><inner>[http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/clubs/profile.stadium.html/liverpool Club Profile: Liverpool]</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> It has been the home of [[Liverpool F.C.]] since their formation in 1892. It was originally the home of [[Everton F.C.]] from 1884 to 1892, when they moved to [[Goodison Park]].

The stadium has four stands: the [[Spion Kop (stadia)|Spion Kop]], Main Stand, Centenary Stand and Anfield Road. The record attendance of 61,905, was set at a match between Liverpool and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in 1952. The ground's conversion to an [[all-seater stadium]] in 1994 as a result of the [[Taylor Report]] greatly reduced its capacity.

Two gates at the ground are named after former Liverpool managers: [[Bill Shankly]] and [[Bob Paisley]]. A statue of Shankly is situated outside the stadium. The ground is <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>2</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>mi</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>km</value></part><part><name index="4"/><value>0</value></part></template> from [[Liverpool Lime Street railway station]].

Plans to replace Anfield with a new 60,000-capacity stadium in adjacent [[Stanley Park Stadium|Stanley Park]] were initiated in 2002. [[Fenway Sports Group]]'s acquisition of Liverpool in 2010 made the construction of a new stadium doubtful as they have said they would prefer to redevelop Anfield.

<h level="2" i="1">==History==</h>
Opened in 1884, Anfield was originally owned by John Orrell, a minor land owner who was a friend of an [[Everton F.C.]] member [[John Houlding]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book|last=Kelly |page=13 |year=1988 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Everton, who previously played at Priory Road, were in need of a new venue owing to the noise produced by the crowd on match days.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;LFC&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/lfc_story/1882.htm |title=LFC Story |publisher=Liverpool F.C|accessdate=23 July 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080619050045/http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/lfc_story/1882.htm |archivedate = 19 June 2008}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Orrell lent the pitch to the club in exchange for a small rent.

The ground was considered of international standard at the time, playing host to the [[British Home Championship]] match between [[England national football team|England]] and [[Ireland national football team (1882-1950)|Ireland]] in 1889. Anfield's first league match was played on 8 September 1888, between Everton and [[Accrington F.C.]] Everton quickly improved as a team, and became Anfield's first league champions in the [[1890–91 in English football|1890–91]] season.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web |title=The Everton Story: 1878–1930 |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/history/everton-the-begining.html|publisher=Everton F.C |accessdate=28 May 2008 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

In 1892, negotiations to purchase the land at Anfield from Orrell escalated into a dispute between Houlding and the Everton F.C. committee over how the club was run. Events culminated in Everton's move to [[Goodison Park]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;LFC&quot; </attr></ext> Houlding was left with an empty stadium, and decided to form a new club to occupy it. The new team was called [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd]], and the club's first match at Anfield was a [[Exhibition game|friendly]] played in front of 200 people on 1 September 1892, against [[Rotherham Town F.C.|Rotherham Town]].

After Liverpool had won their second League championship in [[1905–06 in English football|1906]], a new stand was built along the Walton Breck Road. Local journalist Ernest Edwards, who was the sports editor of newspapers the ''[[Liverpool Daily Post]]'' and ''[[Liverpool Echo|Echo]]'', christened it the [[Spion Kop (stadia)|Spion Kop]]; it was named after a [[Battle of Spion Kop|famous hill]] in South Africa where a local regiment had suffered heavy losses during the [[Boer War]] in 1900. More than 300&amp;nbsp;men had died, many of them from Liverpool, as the British army attempted to capture the strategic hilltop.

Coloured seats and a police room were added to the Kemlyn Road stand in 1987.

Plans to expand the stand had been made earlier, with the club buying up houses on Kemlyn Road during the 1970s and 1980s, but had to be put on hold until 1990 because two sisters, Joan and Nora Mason, refused to sell their house.

During [[Ronnie Moran|Ronnie Moran's]] [[testimonial match]] against [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], many fans complained of movement of the top tier.
