Since its conception, [[Big_Bang#Observational_evidence|abundant evidence]] has arisen to help further validate the theory. 

[[Georges Lemaître]] proposed what became known as the Big Bang theory of the origin of the Universe; he called it his &quot;[[hypothesis]] of the primeval [[atom]]&quot;. The framework for the model relies on [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[general relativity]] and on simplifying assumptions (such as [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]] of space). The governing equations had been formulated by [[Alexander Friedmann]]. In 1929, [[Edwin Hubble]] discovered that the distances to far away [[galaxy|galaxies]] were generally [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to their [[redshift]]s—an idea originally suggested by Lemaître in 1927. Hubble's observation was taken to indicate that all very distant galaxies and clusters have an apparent velocity directly away from our vantage point: the farther away, the higher the apparent velocity.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;hubble&quot;</attr><inner>

On the other hand, these accelerators have limited capabilities to probe into such [[high-energy physics|high energy regimes]]. There is little evidence regarding the absolute earliest instant of the expansion. Thus, the Big Bang theory ''cannot'' and ''does not'' provide any explanation for such an initial condition; rather, it ''describes'' and ''explains'' the general evolution of the universe going forward from that point on. The observed abundances of the light elements throughout the cosmos closely match the calculated predictions for the formation of these elements from nuclear processes in the rapidly expanding and cooling first minutes of the universe, as logically and quantitatively detailed according to [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].

[[Fred Hoyle]] is credited with coining the term ''Big Bang'' during a 1949 radio broadcast. It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative &quot;[[steady state universe|steady state]]&quot; cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>

The Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the Universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912 [[Vesto Slipher]] measured the first [[Doppler shift]] of a &quot;[[spiral nebula]]&quot; (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was [[Shapley–Curtis debate|highly controversial]] whether or not these nebulae were &quot;island universes&quot; outside our [[Milky Way]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>

A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the Universe was dominated by [[photon]]s (with a minor contribution from [[neutrino]]s).

A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million; 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;; SI prefix [[giga-]]) [[kelvin]] and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the Universe's [[deuterium]] and [[helium]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in a process called [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;kolb_c4&quot;</attr></ext> Most protons remained uncombined as [[hydrogen]] nuclei.

Over a long period of time, the slightly denser regions of the nearly uniformly distributed matter gravitationally attracted nearby matter and thus grew even denser, forming gas clouds, [[star]]s, galaxies, and the other astronomical structures observable today. The details of this process depend on the amount and type of matter in the Universe. The four possible types of matter are known as [[cold dark matter]], [[warm dark matter]], [[hot dark matter]] and [[baryonic matter]].

Independent lines of evidence from [[Type Ia supernova]]e and the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] imply that the Universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as [[dark energy]], which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's Universe is in this form. When the Universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity had the upper hand, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the [[Hubble's law|expansion of the Universe]] to slowly begin to accelerate. Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the [[cosmological constant]] term in [[Einstein's field equation]]s of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] and relationship with the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics continue to be investigated both observationally and theoretically.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;peebles&quot; </attr></ext>

All of this cosmic evolution after the [[inflationary epoch]] can be rigorously described and modeled by the [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM model]] of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. As noted above, there is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of [[quantum gravity|quantum gravitation]] is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the Universe is currently one of the greatest [[unsolved problems in physics]].

General relativity describes spacetime by a [[metric tensor|metric]], which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, themselves are specified using a [[coordinate chart]] or &quot;grid&quot; that is laid down over all [[spacetime]]. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]] on large scales, which uniquely singles out the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW metric). This metric contains a [[scale factor]], which describes how the size of the Universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a [[coordinate system]] to be made, called [[comoving coordinates]]. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the Universe, and objects that are moving only due to the expansion of the Universe remain at fixed points on the grid. While their ''coordinate'' distance ([[comoving distance]]) remains constant, the ''physical'' distance between two such comoving points expands proportionally with the [[scale factor]] of the Universe.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>

The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, [[metric expansion of space|space itself expands]] with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our Universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.

<h level="3" i="6">===Horizons===</h>
<template lineStart="1"><title>Main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Cosmological horizon</value></part></template>
An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of [[Observable universe#Cosmological horizon|horizons]]. Since the Universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a ''past horizon'' on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never &quot;catch up&quot; to very distant objects. This defines a ''future horizon'', which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the FLRW model that describes our Universe. Our understanding of the Universe back to very early times [[Big Bang#Horizon problem|suggests]] that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the Universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the Universe continues to [[accelerating universe|accelerate]], there is a future horizon as well.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;kolb_c3&quot;</attr><inner>Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 3</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Observations of distant galaxies and [[quasar]]s show that these objects are [[redshift]]ed—the [[light]] emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a [[frequency spectrum]] of an object and matching the [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] pattern of [[emission line]]s or [[absorption line]]s corresponding to [[atom]]s of the [[chemical element]]s interacting with the light. These redshifts are [[Homogeneity (physics)|uniformly]] [[Isotropy|isotropic]], distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the [[redshift]] is interpreted as a [[Doppler shift]], the recessional [[velocity]] of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the [[cosmic distance ladder]]. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as [[Hubble's law]] is observed:<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;hubble&quot; </attr></ext>
:''v'' = ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''D'',
where
* ''v'' is the recessional [[velocity]] of the [[galaxy]] or other distant object,

* ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[Hubble's constant]], measured to be <template><title>nowrap</title><part><name index="1"/><value>70.4 <template><title>±</title><part><name index="1"/><value>1.3</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>1.4</value></part></template></value></part></template> [[kilometers|km]]/[[second|s]]/[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] by the [[WMAP]] probe.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;wmap7year&quot; </attr></ext>

[[Hubble's law]] has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the [[Copernican Principle]]—or the Universe is [[Metric expansion of space|uniformly expanding]] everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from [[general relativity]] by [[Alexander Friedmann]] in 1922<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=af1922 </attr></ext> and [[Georges Lemaître]] in 1927,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=gl1927 </attr></ext> well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson and Walker]].

The theory requires the relation ''v'' = ''HD'' to hold at all times, where ''D'' is the [[comoving distance]], ''v'' is the [[recessional velocity]], and ''v'', ''H'', and ''D'' vary as the Universe expands (hence we write ''H''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to denote the present-day Hubble &quot;constant&quot;). For distances much smaller than the size of the [[observable Universe]], the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity ''v''. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the Universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;peacock_c3&quot;</attr><inner>Peacock (1999), chapter 3</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

That [[Metric expansion of space|space is undergoing metric expansion]] is shown by direct observational evidence of the [[Cosmological Principle]] and the Copernican Principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical [[redshift]]s are extremely [[isotropic]] and [[Homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogenous]],<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;hubble&quot; </attr></ext> supporting the Cosmological Principle that the Universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.

[[File:WMAP 2010.png|thumb|[[WMAP]] image of the cosmic microwave background radiation]]

During the first few days of the Universe, the Universe was in full [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|thermal equilibrium]], with photons being continually emitted and absorbed, giving the radiation a [[blackbody]] spectrum. As the Universe expanded, it cooled to a temperature at which photons could no longer be created or destroyed. The temperature was still high enough for electrons and nuclei to remain unbound, however, and photons were constantly &quot;reflected&quot; from these free electrons through a process called [[Thomson scattering]]. Because of this repeated scattering, the early Universe was opaque to light.

When the temperature fell to a few thousand [[Kelvin]], electrons and nuclei began to combine to form atoms, a process known as [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]. Since photons scatter infrequently from neutral atoms, radiation decoupled from matter when nearly all the electrons had recombined, at the ''epoch of last scattering'', 379,000 years after the Big Bang. These photons make up the CMB that is observed today, and the observed pattern of fluctuations in the CMB is a direct picture of the Universe at this early epoch. The energy of photons was subsequently redshifted by the expansion of the Universe, which preserved the blackbody spectrum but caused its temperature to fall, meaning that the photons now fall into the [[microwave]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. The radiation is thought to be observable at every point in the Universe, and comes from all directions with (almost) the same intensity.

In 1964, [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] accidentally discovered the cosmic background radiation while conducting diagnostic observations using a new [[microwave]] receiver owned by [[Bell Laboratories]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;penzias&quot; </attr></ext> Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the general CMB predictions—the radiation was found to be isotropic and consistent with a blackbody spectrum of about 3&amp;nbsp;K—and it pitched the balance of opinion in favor of the Big Bang hypothesis. Penzias and Wilson were awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] for their discovery.

In 1989, [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration|NASA]] launched the [[Cosmic Background Explorer satellite]] (COBE), and the initial findings, released in 1990, were consistent with the Big Bang's predictions regarding the CMB. COBE found a residual temperature of 2.726&amp;nbsp;K and in 1992 detected for the first time the fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB, at a level of about one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;cobe&quot; </attr></ext> [[John C. Mather]] and [[George Smoot]] were awarded the Nobel Prize for their leadership in this work. During the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001, several experiments, most notably [[BOOMERanG experiment|BOOMERanG]], found the Universe to be almost spatially flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies. (See [[shape of the Universe]].)

In early 2003, the first results of the [[WMAP|Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. This spacecraft also disproved several specific [[cosmic inflation]] models, but the results were consistent with the inflation theory in general,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;wmap1year&quot; </attr></ext> it confirms too that a sea of [[Cosmic neutrino background|cosmic neutrinos]] permeates the Universe, a clear evidence that the first stars took more than a half-billion years to create a cosmic fog. A new space probe named [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]], with goals similar to WMAP, was launched in May 2009. It is anticipated to soon provide even more accurate measurements of the CMB anisotropies. Many other ground- and balloon-based experiments are also currently running; see [[Cosmic microwave background experiments]].

The background radiation is exceptionally smooth, which presented a problem in that conventional expansion would mean that photons coming from opposite directions in the sky were coming from regions that had never been in contact with each other. The leading explanation for this far reaching equilibrium is that the Universe had a brief period of rapid exponential expansion, called [[cosmic inflation|inflation]]. This would have the effect of driving apart regions that had been in [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|equilibrium]], so that all the observable Universe was from the same equilibrated region.

[[File:2MASS LSS chart-NEW Nasa.jpg|right|thumb|This panoramic view of the entire [[near-infrared]] sky reveals the distribution of galaxies beyond the [[Milky Way]]. The galaxies are color coded by [[redshift]].]]

Detailed observations of the [[Galaxy morphological classification|morphology]] and [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|distribution]] of galaxies and [[quasars]] provide strong evidence for the Big Bang. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then larger structures have been forming, such as [[galaxy groups and clusters|galaxy clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s. Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early Universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of [[star formation]], galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the Universe and are helping to complete details of the theory.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>

After some controversy, the age of Universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the CMB is now in good agreement with (i.e., slightly larger than) the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of [[stellar evolution]] to [[globular clusters]] and through [[radiometric dating]] of individual [[Population II]] stars.<template><title>Citation needed</title><part><name>date</name><equals>=</equals><value>April 2011</value></part></template>

The prediction that the CMB temperature was higher in the past has been experimentally supported by observations of temperature-sensitive emission lines in gas clouds at high redshift. This prediction also implies that the amplitude of the [[Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect]] in [[clusters of galaxies]] does not depend directly on redshift; this seems to be roughly true, but unfortunately the amplitude does depend on cluster properties which do change substantially over cosmic time, so a precise test is impossible.<template><title>Citation needed</title><part><name>date</name><equals>=</equals><value>April 2011</value></part></template>

<h level="2" i="13">==Features, issues and problems==<comment>&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cosmic inflation]] --&gt;</comment></h>
While scientists now prefer the Big Bang model over other cosmological models, the scientific community was once divided between supporters of the Big Bang and those of [[non-standard cosmologies|alternative cosmological models]]. Throughout the historical development of the subject, problems with the Big Bang theory were posed in the context of a scientific controversy regarding which model could best describe the [[observational cosmology|cosmological observations]]. With the overwhelming [[scientific consensus|consensus]] in the community today supporting the Big Bang model, many of these problems are remembered as being mainly of historical interest; the solutions to them have been obtained either through modifications to the theory or as the result of better observations.

The core ideas of the Big Bang—the expansion, the early hot state, the formation of helium, the formation of galaxies—are derived from many observations that are independent from any cosmological model; these include the [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|abundance of light elements]], the [[cosmic microwave background]], [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large scale structure]], and the [[Hubble diagram]] for [[Type Ia supernova]]e.

Precise modern models of the Big Bang appeal to various exotic physical phenomena that have not been observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments or incorporated into the [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]]. Of these features, [[dark matter]] is currently the subject to the most active laboratory investigations.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/astro2010/DetailFileDisplay.aspx?id=225 Direct Searches for Dark Matter], [[White paper]], [http://nationalacademies.org/ The National Academies].</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Remaining issues, such as the [[cuspy halo problem]] and the [[dwarf galaxy problem]] of [[cold dark matter]], are not fatal to the dark matter explanation as solutions to such problems exist which involve only further refinements of the theory. [[Dark energy]] is also an area of intense interest for scientists, but it is not clear whether direct detection of dark energy will be possible.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://www8.nationalacademies.org/astro2010/DetailFileDisplay.aspx?id=243 Whitepaper: For a Comprehensive Space-Based Dark Energy Mission], [http://nationalacademies.org/ The National Academies].</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

On the other hand, [[cosmic inflation|inflation]] and [[baryogenesis]] remain somewhat more speculative features of current Big Bang models: they explain important features of the early universe, but could be replaced by alternative ideas without affecting the rest of the theory.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> group=&quot;notes&quot;</attr><inner>If inflation is true, baryogenesis must have occurred, but not vice versa.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Discovering the correct explanations for such phenomena are some of the remaining [[unsolved problems in physics]].

<h level="3" i="14">===Horizon problem===</h>
<template lineStart="1"><title>Main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Horizon problem</value></part></template>
The horizon problem results from the premise that information cannot travel [[faster than light]]. In a Universe of finite age, this sets a limit—the [[particle horizon]]—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in [[causality (physics)|causal]] contact.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;kolb_c8&quot;</attr><inner>Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 8</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The observed isotropy of the CMB is problematic in this regard: if the Universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.

A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by [[inflationary theory]] in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the Universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the Universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable Universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.

[[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be [[primordial fluctuations|quantum thermal fluctuations]], which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the Universe. Inflation predicts that the [[primordial fluctuations]] are nearly [[Scale invariance|scale invariant]] and [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.

If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.

Curvature is negative if its density is less than the [[critical density]], positive if greater, and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be ''flat''.

For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes
(the time of nucleosynthesis), the Universe density must have been within one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>

A resolution to this problem is offered by [[inflationary theory]]. During the inflationary period, spacetime expanded to such an extent that its [[curvature]] would have been smoothed out. Thus, it is theorized that inflation drove the Universe to a very nearly spatially flat state, with almost exactly the critical density.

These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early Universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that searches have never found any monopoles.

During the 1970s and 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the Universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the Universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal [[baryon]]ic matter. In addition, the assumption that the Universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the Universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less [[deuterium]] than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter was initially controversial, it is now indicated by numerous observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, [[galaxy groups and clusters|galaxy cluster]] velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, [[gravitational lensing]] studies, and [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray measurements]] of galaxy clusters.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>

<h level="3" i="20">===Dark energy===</h>
<template lineStart="1"><title>Main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Dark energy</value></part></template>
Measurements of the [[redshift]]–[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] relation for [[type Ia supernova]]e indicate that the expansion of the Universe has been [[accelerating universe|accelerating]] since the Universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, [[general relativity]] requires that much of the energy in the Universe consists of a component with large [[equation of state (cosmology)|negative pressure]], dubbed &quot;[[dark energy]]&quot;. Dark energy is indicated by several other lines of evidence. Measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]] indicate that the Universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the Universe must have almost exactly the [[critical density]] of mass/energy. But the [[density|mass density]] of the Universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;peebles&quot; </attr></ext> Since dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the &quot;missing&quot; energy density. Dark energy is also required by two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the Universe, one using the frequency of [[gravitational lens]]es, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the [[large-scale structure]] as a cosmic ruler.

Negative pressure is a property of [[vacuum energy]], but the exact nature of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Possible candidates include a [[cosmological constant]] and [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]. Results from the WMAP team in 2008, which combined data from the CMB and other sources, indicate that the contributions to mass/energy density in the Universe today are approximately 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;wmap7year&quot; </attr></ext> The energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the Universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the Universe expands. Therefore matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the Universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.

In the [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM]], the best current model of the Big Bang, dark energy is explained by the presence of a [[cosmological constant]] in the [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]]. However, the size of the constant that properly explains dark energy is surprisingly small relative to naive estimates based on ideas about [[quantum gravity]]. Distinguishing between the cosmological constant and other explanations of dark energy is an active area of current research.

<h level="2" i="21">==The future according to the Big Bang theory==</h>
<template lineStart="1"><title>Main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Ultimate fate of the universe</value></part></template>
Before observations of [[dark energy]], cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the Universe. If the mass [[density]] of the Universe were greater than the [[critical density]], then the Universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state that was similar to that in which it started—a [[Big Crunch]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;kolb_c3&quot;</attr><inner>Kolb and Turner, 1988, chapter 3</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Alternatively, if the density in the Universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down, but never stop. Star formation would cease as all the interstellar gas in each galaxy is consumed; stars would burn out leaving [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]]s. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the Universe would asymptotically approach [[absolute zero]]—a [[Big Freeze]]. Moreover, if the proton were [[proton decay|unstable]], then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting [[Hawking radiation]]. The [[entropy]] of the Universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as [[heat death]].

Modern observations of [[accelerating universe|accelerated expansion]] imply that more and more of the currently visible Universe will pass beyond our [[event horizon]] and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The [[Lambda-CDM model|ΛCDM model]] of the Universe contains [[dark energy]] in the form of a [[cosmological constant]]. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, would remain together, and they too would be subject to [[heat death]], as the Universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy—so-called [[phantom energy]] theories—suggest that ultimately [[galaxy groups and clusters|galaxy clusters]], stars, planets, atoms, nuclei and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called [[Big Rip]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>

The [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems]] require the existence of a [[gravitational singularity|singularity]] at the beginning of cosmic time.

Proposals in the last two categories see the Big Bang as an event in a much larger and older Universe, or [[multiverse]], and not the literal beginning.

The Big Bang is a [[scientific theory]], and as such is dependent on its agreement with observations. But as a theory which addresses the origins of reality, it has always carried theological and philosophical implications, most notably, the concept of creation ''[[ex nihilo]]'' (a Latin phrase meaning &quot;out of nothing&quot;).<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Russell - Theological Implications&quot;</attr><inner>

 |quote=Amazingly, some secularists attribute to t=0 a direct implication. The June 1978 issue of the ''New York Times'' contained an article by NASA's Robert Jastrow, an avowed agnostic, entitled &quot;Found God?&quot; Here Jastrow depicts the theologians to be &quot;delighted&quot; that astronomical evidence &quot;leads to a biblical view of Genesis.&quot; Though claiming to be agnostic, he argued without reservation for the religious significance of t=0: It is beyond science and leads to some sort of creator.

Incredibly enough, modern theoretical physicists have also speculated that the universe may have been produced through a sudden quantum appearance &quot;out of nothing.&quot; Physicist Paul Davies has claimed that the particular physicis involved in the Big Bang ''necessitates'' creation ''ex nihilo''.

In February of 1989, for example, the front-page article of the ''New York Times Book Review'' argued that scientists and novelists were returning to God, in large part through the influence of the Big Bang.

Since the acceptance of the Big Bang as the dominant physical cosmological paradigm, there have been a variety of reactions by religious groups as to its [[Religious interpretations of the Big Bang theory|implications]] for their respective [[religious cosmology|religious cosmologies]]. Some accept the scientific evidence at face value, while others seek to reconcile the Big Bang with their religious tenets, and others completely reject or ignore the evidence for the Big Bang theory.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>
