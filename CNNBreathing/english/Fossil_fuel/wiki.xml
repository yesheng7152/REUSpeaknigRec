'''Fossil fuels''' are fuels formed by natural resources such as [[anaerobic decomposition]] of buried dead [[organism]]s.  The age of the organisms and their resulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years, and sometimes exceeds 650 million years.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Paul Mann, Lisa Gahagan, and Mark B.

Fossil fuels range from [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile materials]] with low [[carbon]]:[[hydrogen]] ratios like [[methane]], to liquid [[petroleum]] to nonvolatile materials composed of almost pure carbon, like [[anthracite]] [[coal]]. Methane can be found in hydrocarbon fields, alone, associated with oil, or in the form of [[methane clathrates]]. It is generally accepted that they formed from the [[fossil|fossilized remains]] of dead plants and animals<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|author=Dr. Irene Novaczek|title=Canada's Fossil Fuel Dependency|url=http://www.elements.nb.ca/theme/fuels/irene/novaczek.htm|publisher=Elements|accessdate =2007-01-18}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> by exposure to heat and pressure in the Earth's crust over millions of years.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|title=Fossil fuel|url=http://oaspub.epa.gov/trs/trs_proc_qry.navigate_term?p_term_id=7068&amp;p_term_cd=TERM|publisher=EPA|accessdate=2007-01-18}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> This [[Petroleum#Biogenic theory|biogenic theory]] was first introduced by [[Georg Agricola]] in 1556 and later by [[Mikhail Lomonosov]] in the 18th century.

It  was estimated by the [[Energy Information Administration]] that in 2007 primary sources of energy consisted of petroleum 36.0%, coal 27.4%, natural gas 23.0%, amounting to an 86.4% share for fossil fuels in primary energy consumption in the world.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/IEDIndex3.cfm|title=U.S. EIA International Energy Statistics|accessdate=2010-01-12}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>. Non-fossil sources in 2006 included [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] 6.3%, [[Nuclear power|nuclear]] 8.5%, and ([[Geothermal power|geothermal]], [[Solar energy|solar]], [[Tide power|tide]], [[Wind power|wind]], [[Wood fuel|wood]], [[Waste-to-energy|waste]]) amounting 0.9 percent.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/iea/overview.html|title=International Energy Annual 2006|accessdate=2009-02-08}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> World energy consumption was growing about 2.3% per year.

Fossil fuels are [[non-renewable resources]] because they take millions of years to form, and reserves are being depleted much faster than new ones are being made. The production and use of fossil fuels raise environmental concerns. A global movement toward the generation of [[renewable energy]] is therefore under way to help meet increased energy needs.

The burning of fossil fuels produces around 21.3 billion [[tonnes]] (21.3 [[gigatonne]]s) of [[carbon dioxide]] per year, but it is estimated that natural processes can only absorb about half of that amount, so there is a net increase of 10.65 billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon dioxide per year (one tonne of atmospheric carbon is equivalent to 44/12 or 3.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide).<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url= http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggccebro/chapter1.html|title=US Department of Energy on greenhouse gases|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>   Carbon dioxide is one of the [[greenhouse gas]]es that enhances [[radiative forcing]] and contributes to [[global warming]], causing the [[Instrumental temperature record|average surface temperature]] of the Earth to rise in response, which [[Scientific opinion on climate change|climate scientists]] agree will cause major adverse [[Effects of global warming|effects]].

<h level="2" i="1">==Origin==</h>
Fossil fuels are formed by  the [[anaerobic decomposition]] of remains of organisms including [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] that settled to the sea (or lake) bottom in large quantities under [[anoxic sea water|anoxic conditions]], millions of years ago. Over [[geologic time scale|geological time]], this [[organic compound|organic]] [[matter]], mixed with [[mud]], got buried under heavy layers of sediment. The resulting high levels of [[heat]] and [[pressure]] caused the organic matter to chemically [[diagenesis|alter]], first into a waxy material known as [[kerogen]] which is found in [[oil shale]]s, and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons in a process known as [[catagenesis (geology)|catagenesis]].

There is a wide range of organic, or hydrocarbon, compounds in any given fuel mixture. The specific mixture of hydrocarbons gives a fuel its characteristic properties, such as boiling point, melting point, density, viscosity, etc. Some fuels like natural gas, for instance, contain only very low boiling, gaseous components. Others such as gasoline or diesel contain much higher boiling components.

[[Terrestrial plant]]s, on the other hand, tend to form [[coal]] and methane. Many of the coal fields date to the [[Carboniferous]] period of [[History of Earth|Earth's history]]. Terrestrial plants also form [[Kerogen#Type III|type III kerogen]], a source of [[natural gas]].

Fossil fuels are of great importance because they can be burned ([[oxidized]] to [[carbon dioxide]] and water), producing significant amounts of energy. The use of [[coal]] as a fuel predates recorded history. Coal was used to run furnaces for the melting of metal ore. Semi-solid hydrocarbons from seeps were also burned in ancient times,<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url= http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-50695 |title=Encyclopedia Britannica, use of oil seeps in accient times|accessdate=2007-09-09}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> but these materials were mostly used for waterproofing and [[embalming]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Cite web

Prior to the latter half of the eighteenth century, [[windmill]]s or [[watermill]]s provided the energy needed for industry such as milling [[flour]], [[sawmill|sawing wood]] or pumping water, and burning wood or [[peat]] provided domestic heat. The wide-scale use of fossil fuels, coal at first and petroleum later,  to fire [[steam engines]], enabled the [[Industrial Revolution]].  At the same time, [[Gas lighting|gas lights]] using natural gas or [[coal gas]] were coming into wide use. The invention of the [[internal combustion engine]] and its use in [[automobile]]s and [[truck]]s greatly increased the demand for [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel oil]], both made from fossil fuels. Other forms of transportation, [[rail transport|railways]] and [[aircraft]] also required fossil fuels. The other major use for fossil fuels is in [[Electrical power industry|generating electricity]] and the [[petrochemical]] industry. [[Tar]], a leftover of petroleum extraction, is used in construction of roads.

Levels of primary energy sources are the reserves in the ground. Flows are production. The most important part of primary energy sources are the [[carbon]] based fossil energy sources. Coal, oil, and natural gas provided 79.6% of primary energy production during 2002 (in million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe)) (34.9+23.5+21.2).

The calculation above assumes that the product could be produced at a constant level for that number of years and that all of the proved reserves could be recovered. In reality, consumption of all three resources has been increasing. While this suggests that the resource will be used up more quickly, in reality, the production curve is much more akin to a bell curve. At some point in time, the production of each resource within an area, country, or globally will reach a maximum value, after which, the production will decline until it reaches a point where is no longer economically feasible or physically possible to produce. See [[Hubbert peak theory]] for detail on this decline curve with regard to petroleum. Note also that proved reserve estimates do not include strategic reserves, which (globally) amount to 4.1 billion more barrels.

The above discussion emphasizes worldwide energy balance.  It is also valuable to understand the ratio of reserves to annual consumption ([[Reserves-to-production ratio|R/C]]) by region or country.  For example, [[energy policy of the United Kingdom]] recognizes that Europe's R/C value is 3.0, very low by world standards, and exposes that region to energy vulnerability. Alternatives to fossil fuels are a subject of intense debate worldwide.

<template lineStart="1"><title>Main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Peak oil</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>Hubbert peak theory</value></part></template>
The principle of [[supply and demand]] suggests that as hydrocarbon supplies diminish, prices will rise. Therefore higher prices will lead to increased alternative, [[renewable energy]] supplies as previously uneconomic sources become sufficiently economical to exploit.  Artificial gasolines and other [[renewable energy]] sources currently require more expensive production and processing technologies than conventional petroleum reserves, but may become economically viable in the near future. See [[Energy development]]. In 2000 it was estimated that there are 25-40 years' worth of oil remaining in the Earth to be extracted and used, based on current rates, 70 years' worth of coal, and 200 years' worth of natural gas.
Different alternative sources of energy include [[Nuclear power|nuclear]], [[hydroelectric]], [[Solar energy|solar]], wind, and [[Geothermal power|geothermal]].

In the United States, more than 90% of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions come from the combustion of fossil fuels.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>US EPA.2000.

According to Environment Canada:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The electricity sector is unique among industrial sectors in its very large contribution to emissions associated with nearly all air issues. Electricity generation produces a large share of Canadian nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide emissions, which contribute to smog and acid rain and the formation of fine particulate matter. It is the largest uncontrolled industrial source of mercury emissions in Canada. Fossil fuel-fired electric power plants also emit carbon dioxide, which may contribute to climate change. In addition, the sector has significant impacts on water and habitat and species. In particular, hydro dams and transmission lines have significant effects on water and biodiversity.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/cleanair-airpur/Electricity-WSDC4D330A-1_En.htm|title=Electricity Generation|accessdate=2007-03-23}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

According to U.S. Scientist Jerry Mahlman and USA Today:
Mahlman, who crafted the IPCC language used to define levels of scientific certainty, says the new report will lay the blame at the feet of fossil fuels with &quot;virtual certainty,&quot; meaning 99% sure. That's a significant jump from &quot;likely,&quot; or 66% sure, in the group's last report in 2001, Mahlman says. His role in this year's effort involved spending two months reviewing the more than 1,600 pages of research that went into the new assessment.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2007-01-30-ipcc-report_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Fossil fuels are to blame, world scientists conclude | first1=Patrick | last1=O'Driscoll | first2=Dan | last2=Vergano | date=2007-03-01 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Combustion of fossil fuels generates sulfuric, carbonic, and [[nitric acid]]s, which fall to Earth as [[acid rain]], impacting both natural areas and the built environment.  Monuments and sculptures made from [[marble]] and limestone are particularly vulnerable, as the acids dissolve [[calcium carbonate]].

Fossil fuels also contain radioactive materials, mainly [[uranium]] and [[thorium]], which are released into the atmosphere. In 2000, about 12,000 [[tonnes]] of thorium and 5,000 tonnes of uranium were released worldwide from burning coal.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev26-34/text/colmain.html Coal Combustion: Nuclear Resource or Danger] - Alex Gabbard</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  It is estimated that during 1982, US coal burning released 155 times as much radioactivity into the atmosphere as the [[Three Mile Island]] incident.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~aubrecht/coalvsnucMarcon.pdf#page=8 Nuclear proliferation through coal burning] - Gordon J.

Burning coal also generates large amounts of [[bottom ash]] and [[fly ash]]. These materials are used in a wide variety of [[Fly ash#Fly ash reuse|applications]], utilizing, for example, about 40% of the US production.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | author = American Coal Ash Association | title = &quot;CCP Production and Use Survey&quot;| url = http://www.acaa-usa.org/PDF/2005_CCP_Production_and_Use_Figures_Released_by_ACAA.pdf|format=PDF}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Harvesting, processing, and distributing fossil fuels can also create environmental concerns. [[Coal mining]] methods, particularly mountaintop removal and strip mining, have negative environmental impacts, and offshore oil drilling poses a hazard to aquatic organisms. [[Oil refinery|Oil refineries]] also have negative environmental impacts, including air and water pollution. Transportation of coal requires the use of diesel-powered locomotives, while crude oil is typically transported by tanker ships, each of which requires the combustion of additional fossil fuels.

[[Environmental regulation]] uses a variety of approaches to limit these emissions, such as command-and-control (which mandates the amount of pollution or the technology used), economic incentives, or voluntary programs.

An example of such regulation in the USA is the &quot;EPA is implementing policies to reduce airborne mercury emissions. Under regulations issued in 2005, coal-fired power plants will need to reduce their emissions by 70 percent by 2018.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/promotions/change_light/downloads/Fact_Sheet_Mercury.pdf|format=PDF|title=Frequently Asked Questions, Information on Proper Disposal of Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs (CFLs)|accessdate=2007-03-19}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>.

In economic terms, pollution from fossil fuels is regarded as a negative [[externality]].   Taxation is considered one way to make societal costs explicit, in order to 'internalize' the cost of pollution.  This aims to make fossil fuels more expensive, thereby reducing their use and the amount of pollution associated with them, along with raising the funds necessary to counteract these factors.

Former CIA Director James Woolsey recently outlined the national security arguments in favor of moving away from fossil fuels.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://www.law.uh.edu/eelpj/symposium.html Video of Woolsey speech]</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>
