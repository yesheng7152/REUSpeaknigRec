Iapetus is best known for its dramatic 'two-tone' coloration, but discoveries by the ''[[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]]'' mission in 2007 have revealed several other unusual physical characteristics, such as an equatorial ridge that runs about halfway around the moon.

<h level="2" i="1">== Discovery ==</h>

Iapetus was discovered by [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]], an Italian–French astronomer, in October 1671. He had discovered the moon on the western side of Saturn and tried viewing it on the eastern side some months later, but was unsuccessful. The pattern continued the following year as he was able to observe it on the western side, but not the eastern side. Cassini finally observed Iapetus on the eastern side in 1705 with the help of an improved telescope, finding it two [[apparent magnitude|magnitudes]] dimmer on that side.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Van Helden, A., &quot;Saturn through the telescope: A brief historical survey&quot;, ''Saturn'', Tucson: University of Arizona Press, pp. 23–43 (1984).</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Harland, David M., ''Mission to Saturn: Cassini and the Huygens Probe'', Chichester: Praxis Publishing (2002).</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Cassini correctly surmised that Iapetus has a bright hemisphere and a dark hemisphere, and that it is [[tidal locking|tidally locked]], always keeping the same face towards Saturn. This means that the bright hemisphere is visible from Earth when Iapetus is on the western side of Saturn, and that the dark hemisphere is visible when Iapetus is on the eastern side. The dark hemisphere was later named [[Cassini Regio]] in his honour.

<h level="2" i="2">== Name ==</h>

Iapetus is named after the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]] from [[Greek mythology]]. The name was suggested by [[John Herschel]] (son of [[William Herschel]], discoverer of Mimas and Enceladus) in his 1847 publication ''Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope'',<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Lassell&quot; </attr></ext> in which he advocated naming the moons of Saturn after the Titans, sisters and brothers of the Titan [[Cronus]] (whom the [[Roman mythology|Romans]] equated with their god [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]).

When first discovered, Iapetus was among four [[Moons of Saturn|Saturnian moons]] labelled the ''[[Sidera Lodoicea]]'' by their discoverer [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Giovanni Cassini]] after [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] (the other three were [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], [[Dione (moon)|Dione]] and [[Rhea (moon)|Rhea]]). However, astronomers fell into the habit of referring to them using Roman numerals, with Iapetus being '''Saturn V'''. Once [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] and [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] were discovered in 1789, the numbering scheme was extended and Iapetus became '''Saturn&amp;nbsp;VII'''. And with the discovery of [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]] in 1848, Iapetus became ''Saturn VIII'', which it is still known by today (see [[Astronomical naming conventions#Natural satellites of planets|naming of natural satellites]]).

Geological features on Iapetus are named after characters and places from the French epic poem ''[[The Song of Roland]]''. Examples of names used include the craters [[Charlemagne (crater)|Charlemagne]] and [[Baligant (crater)|Baligant]], and the northern bright region, [[Roncevaux Terra]]. The one exception is [[Cassini Regio]], the dark region of the moon, named after the region's discoverer, Giovanni Cassini.

<h level="3" i="4">=== Two-tone coloration ===</h>

In the 17th century, [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini|Giovanni Cassini]] observed that he could see Iapetus only on the west side of Saturn and never on the east. He correctly deduced that Iapetus is locked in [[synchronous rotation]] about Saturn and that one side of Iapetus is darker than the other, conclusions later confirmed by larger telescopes.

[[File:Iapetus Spins and Tilts.jpg|thumb|left|View of Cassini Regio. Large craters visible include Falsaron (upper left), [[Turgis (crater)|Turgis]] (above and right of center) and Ganelon (lower right)]]
[[File:Iapetus Roncevaux Terra PIA09756.jpg|thumb|left|The bright regions of Iapetus. Roncevaux Terra is at the top (north); Saragossa Terra with its prominent basin Engelier, the moon's second largest, is at the bottom.]]

The difference in colouring between the two Iapetian hemispheres is striking. The leading hemisphere and sides are dark ([[albedo]] 0.03–0.05) with a slight [[red]]dish-brown coloring, while most of the trailing hemisphere and poles are bright (albedo 0.5–0.6, almost as bright as [[Europa (moon)|Europa]]). Thus, the [[apparent magnitude]] of the trailing hemisphere is around 10.2, whereas that of the leading hemisphere is around 11.9&amp;nbsp;– beyond the capacity of the best [[telescope]]s in the 17th century. The pattern of coloration is analogous to a spherical [[yin-yang]] symbol or the two sections of a tennis ball. The dark region is named [[Cassini Regio]], and the bright region is divided into [[Roncevaux Terra]] north of the equator, and [[Saragossa Terra]] south of it. The original dark material is believed to have come from outside Iapetus, but now it consists principally of lag from the [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] of ice from the warmer areas of Iapetus's surface.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Mason&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web

NASA scientists now believe that the dark material is lag (residue) from the [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]] (evaporation) of water ice on the surface of Iapetus,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Denk&quot; </attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;jpl779&quot; </attr></ext> possibly darkened further upon exposure to sunlight. Because of its slow rotation of 79&amp;nbsp;days (equal to its revolution and the longest in the Saturnian system), Iapetus would have had the warmest daytime surface temperature and coldest nighttime temperature in the Saturnian system even before the development of the color contrast; near the equator, heat absorption by the dark material results in a daytime temperatures of 129&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] in the dark Cassini Regio compared to 113&amp;nbsp;K in the bright regions.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Spencer&quot; </attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;jpl2776&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite web|url=http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/imagedetails/index.cfm?imageId=2776 |title=Cassini–Huygens: Multimedia-Images |publisher=Saturn.jpl.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The difference in temperature means that ice preferentially sublimates from Cassini, and [[Deposition (phase transition)|deposits]] in the bright areas and especially at the even colder poles. Over geologic time scales, this would further darken Cassini Regio and brighten the rest of Iapetus, creating a [[positive feedback]] [[thermal runaway]] process of ever greater contrast in albedo, ending with all exposed ice being lost from Cassini.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Spencer&quot; </attr></ext> It is estimated that over a period of one billion years at current temperatures, dark areas of Iapetus would lose about 20 meters of ice to sublimation, while the bright regions would lose only 10 centimeters, not considering the ice transferred from the dark regions.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;jpl2776&quot; </attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091210173611.htm |title=Dark Side of a Saturnian Moon: Iapetus Is Coated With Foreign Dust |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=2009-12-11 |accessdate=2012-07-30}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> This model explains the distribution of light and dark areas, the absence of shades of grey, and the thinness of the dark material covering Cassini. The redistribution of ice is facilitated by Iapetus's weak gravity, which means that at ambient temperatures a water molecule can migrate from one hemisphere to the other in just a few hops.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Spencer&quot; </attr></ext>

However, a separate process of color segregation would be required to get the thermal feedback started. The initial dark material is thought to have been debris blasted by meteors off small outer moons in [[Retrograde motion|retrograde]] orbits and swept up by the leading hemisphere of Iapetus. The core of this model is some 30 years old, and was revived by the September 2007 flyby.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Mason&quot; </attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Denk&quot; </attr></ext>

Light debris outside of Iapetus's orbit, either knocked free from the surface of a moon by [[micrometeoroid]] impacts or created in a collision, would spiral in as [[Poynting–Robertson effect|its orbit decays]]. It would have been darkened by exposure to sunlight. A portion of any such material that crossed Iapetus's orbit would have been swept up by its leading hemisphere, coating it; once this process created a modest contrast in albedo, and so a contrast in temperature, the thermal feedback described above would have come into play and exaggerated the contrast.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Denk&quot; </attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Spencer&quot; </attr></ext> In support of the hypothesis, simple numerical models of the exogenic deposition and thermal water redistribution processes can closely predict the two-toned appearance of Iapetus.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Spencer&quot; </attr></ext> A subtle color dichotomy between Iapetus's leading and trailing hemispheres, with the former being more reddish, can in fact be observed in comparisons between both bright and dark areas of the two hemispheres.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Denk&quot; </attr></ext> In contrast to the elliptical shape of Cassini Regio, the color contrast closely follows the hemisphere boundaries; the gradation between the differently colored regions is gradual, on a scale of hundreds of km.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Denk&quot; </attr></ext> The next moon inward from Iapetus, chaotically rotating [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]], also has an unusual reddish color.

The observed oblateness corresponds to a rotation period of 10 hours, not to the 79 days observed.

A further mystery of Iapetus is the [[equatorial ridge]] that runs along the center of Cassini Regio, about 1,300&amp;nbsp;km long, 20&amp;nbsp;km wide, 13&amp;nbsp;km high. It was discovered when the ''Cassini'' spacecraft imaged Iapetus on December 31, 2004. Peaks in the ridge rise more than 20&amp;nbsp;km above the surrounding plains, making them some of the [[tallest mountains in the Solar System]]. The ridge forms a complex system including isolated peaks, segments of more than 200&amp;nbsp;km and sections with three near parallel ridges.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;porco2005&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite journal

It is not clear how the ridge formed. One difficulty is to explain why it follows the equator almost perfectly. There are at least four current hypotheses, but none of them explains why the ridge is confined to Cassini Regio.

If Iapetus cooled fast enough to preserve the ridge but remained plastic long enough for the [[tide]]s raised by Saturn to have slowed the rotation to its current tidally locked 79 days, Iapetus must have been heated by the radioactive decay of [[aluminium-26]]. This [[isotope]] appears to have been abundant in the [[solar nebula]] from which Saturn formed, but has since all decayed. The quantities of aluminium-26 needed to heat Iapetus to the required temperature give a tentative date to its formation relative to the rest of the Solar System: Iapetus must have come together earlier than expected, only two million years after the [[asteroid]]s started to form.
# The ridge could be icy material that welled up from beneath the surface and then solidified.

<h level="2" i="8">== Orbit ==</h>

The orbit of Iapetus is somewhat unusual. Although it is Saturn's third-largest moon, it orbits much farther from Saturn than the next closest major moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. It has also the most inclined orbital plane of the regular satellites; only the irregular outer satellites like [[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]] have more inclined orbits. The cause of this is unknown.

Because of this distant, inclined orbit, Iapetus is the only large moon from which the rings of Saturn would be clearly visible; from the other inner moons, the rings would be edge-on and difficult to see. From Iapetus, Saturn would appear to be 1°56' in [[angular diameter|diameter]] (four times the size of the [[Moon]] viewed from [[Earth]]).<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Angular diameter calculated using [[Celestia]] software.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="2" i="9">== Exploration ==</h>

Iapetus has been imaged multiple times from moderate distances by the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini orbiter]]. However, its great distance from Saturn makes close observation difficult. There has been one close targeted flyby, at a minimum range of 1227&amp;nbsp;km, on September 10, 2007; no additional close flybys are planned. One viewing opportunity is possible in 2015.
