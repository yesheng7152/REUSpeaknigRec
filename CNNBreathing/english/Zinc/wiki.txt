'''Zinc''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|ɪ|ŋ|k|}} {{respell|zingk|'}}; from {{lang-de|Zink}}), or '''spelter''' (which may also refer to [[spelter|zinc alloy]]s), is a [[metal]]lic [[chemical element]]; it has the symbol '''Zn''' and [[atomic number]] 30. It is the first element in [[group 12 element|group 12]] of the [[periodic table]]. Zinc is, in some respects, chemically similar to [[magnesium]], because its [[ion]] is of similar size and its only common [[oxidation state]] is +2. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in the Earth's crust and has five stable [[isotope]]s. The most common zinc [[ore]] is [[sphalerite]] (zinc blende), a [[zinc sulfide]] mineral. The largest mineable amounts are found in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc production includes [[froth flotation]] of the ore, [[Roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]], and final [[extractive metallurgy|extraction]] using electricity ([[electrowinning]]). 

[[Brass]], which is an [[alloy]] of copper and zinc, has been used since at least the 10th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC. Impure zinc metal was not produced in large scale until the 13th century in India, while the metal was unknown to Europe until the end of the 16th century. [[alchemy|Alchemists]] burned zinc in air to form what they called "[[philosopher's wool]]" or "white snow".
 
The element was probably named by the alchemist [[Paracelsus]] after the German word ''Zinke''. German chemist [[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf]] is normally given credit for discovering pure metallic zinc in 1746. Work by [[Luigi Galvani]] and [[Alessandro Volta]] uncovered the electrochemical properties of zinc by 1800. [[Corrosion]]-resistant [[galvanization|zinc plating]] of steel ([[hot-dip galvanizing]]) is the major application for zinc. Other applications are in [[Zinc–carbon battery|batteries]] and alloys, such as [[brass]]. A variety of zinc compounds are commonly used, such as [[zinc carbonate]] and [[zinc gluconate]] (as dietary supplements), [[zinc chloride]] (in deodorants), [[zinc pyrithione]] (anti-[[dandruff]] shampoos), [[zinc sulfide]] (in luminescent paints), and zinc methyl or [[zinc diethyl]] in the organic laboratory.

Zinc is an [[micronutrient|essential mineral]] of "exceptional biologic and public health importance".<ref name=Hambridge2007>{{Cite journal|author=Hambidge, K. M. and Krebs, N.

Zinc makes up about 75&nbsp;[[parts-per notation|ppm]]&nbsp;(0.0075%) of the [[Earth's crust]], making it the 24th most abundant element. Soil contains 5–770&nbsp;ppm of zinc with an average of 64&nbsp;ppm.

===Reactivity===
Zinc has an [[electron configuration]] of [Ar]3d<sup>10</sup>4s<sup>2</sup> and is a member of the [[group 12 element|group 12]] of the [[periodic table]]. It is a moderately reactive metal and strong [[reducing agent]].<ref name=CRC2006p8-29>{{harvnb|CRC|2006|pp='''8'''–29}}</ref> The surface of the pure metal [[tarnish]]es quickly, eventually forming a protective [[passivation|passivating]] layer of the basic [[Hydrozincite|zinc carbonate]], {{chem|Zn|5|(OH)|6|(CO|3|)|2|}}, by reaction with atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]].<ref>{{Cite book|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|page=121|isbn=0824792130|title=Corrosion Resistance of Zinc and Zinc Alloys| first=Frank C.|last=Porter}}</ref> This layer helps prevent further reaction with air and water.

Zinc burns in air with a bright bluish-green flame, giving off fumes of [[zinc oxide]].<ref name="Holl"/> Zinc reacts readily with [[acid]]s, [[alkali]]s and other non-metals.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hinds|first=John Iredelle Dillard|title=Inorganic Chemistry: With the Elements of Physical and Theoretical Chemistry|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|year=1908|edition=2nd|pages=506–508|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xMUMAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> Extremely pure zinc reacts only slowly at room temperature with acids.<ref name="Holl"/> Strong acids, such as [[hydrochloric acid|hydrochloric]] or [[sulfuric acid]], can remove the passivating layer and subsequent reaction with water releases hydrogen gas.<ref name="Holl"/> 

The chemistry of zinc is dominated by the +2 oxidation state. When compounds in this oxidation state are formed the outer [[electron shell|shell]] ''s'' electrons are lost, which yields a bare zinc ion with the electronic configuration [Ar]3d<sup>10</sup>.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ritchie|first=Rob|title=Chemistry|publisher=Letts and Lonsdale|year=2004|edition=2nd|page=71|isbn=1843154382|url=http://books.google.com/?id=idT9j6406gsC}}</ref> This allows for the formation of four [[covalent bond]]s by accepting four electron pairs and thus obeying the [[octet rule]].

Zinc chemistry is similar to the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals [[nickel]] and copper, though it has a filled d-shell, so its compounds are [[diamagnetic]] and mostly colorless.<ref name="Greenwood1997p1206"/> The [[ionic radii]] of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of their salts have the same [[crystal structure]]<ref>{{harvnb|CRC|2006|pp='''12'''–11–12}}</ref> and in circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor zinc and magnesium chemistries have much in common.<ref name="Holl">{{Cite book|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1985|edition=91–100| pages=1034–1041|isbn=3-11-007511-3|title=Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first=Arnold F.|last=Holleman|coauthors=Wiberg, Egon; Wiberg, Nils;|language=German|chapter=Zink}}</ref> Otherwise there is little similarity. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of [[covalency]] and it forms much more stable [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] with [[nitrogen|N]]- and [[sulfur|S]]- donors.<ref name="Greenwood1997p1206">{{harvnb|Greenwood|1997|p=1206}}</ref> Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- [[coordinate covalent bond|coordinate]] although 5-coordinate complexes are known.<ref name="Holl"/>

German chemist [[Andreas Sigismund Marggraf|Andreas Marggraf]] normally gets credit for discovering pure metallic zinc even though Swedish chemist Anton von Swab distilled zinc from calamine four years before.<ref name="iza" /> In his 1746 experiment, Marggraf heated a mixture of calamine and charcoal in a closed vessel without copper to obtain a metal.<ref name="Weeks1933p21"/> This procedure became commercially practical by 1752.<ref>{{harvnb|Heiserman|1992|p=122}}</ref>

A key step in the [[catalytic cycle]] is a [[transmetalation]] in which a zinc halide exchanges its organic substituent for another halogen with the palladium (nickel) metal center. The [[Fukuyama coupling]] is another coupling reaction but this one with a thioester as reactant forming a ketone.

Organozinc compounds usually contain zinc in +2 oxidation state, but compound in +1 state are also known such as [[decamethyldizincocene]].

Carboxypeptidase cleaves peptide linkages during digestion of proteins. A [[coordinate covalent bond]] is formed between the terminal peptide and a C=O group attached to zinc, which gives the carbon a positive charge.

Zinc deficiency is crop plants' most common micronutrient deficiency; it is particularly common in high-pH soils. Zinc-deficient [[soil]] is [[Tillage|cultivated]] in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third of China, and most of Western Australia, and substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas.<ref name=Broadley2007/> Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is primarily added to the soil through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread.<ref name=Broadley2007/>

With the new zinc pennies, there is the potential for zinc toxicosis, which can be fatal. One reported case of chronic ingestion of 425 pennies (over 1&nbsp;kg of zinc) resulted in death due to gastrointestinal bacterial and fungal [[sepsis]], while another patient, who ingested 12&nbsp;grams of zinc, only showed [[lethargy]] and [[ataxia]] (gross lack of coordination of muscle movements).<ref>{{cite journal

Pennies and other small coins are sometimes ingested by dogs, resulting in the need for medical treatment to remove the foreign body. The zinc content of some coins can cause zinc toxicity, which is commonly fatal in dogs, where it causes a severe [[hemolytic anemia]], and also liver or kidney damage; vomiting and diarrhea are possible symptoms.<ref name="Stowe1978">{{cite journal|last=Stowe|first=C.
