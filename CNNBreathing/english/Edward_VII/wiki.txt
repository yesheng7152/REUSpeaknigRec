'''Edward VII''' (Albert Edward; 9 November 1841&nbsp;– 6 May 1910) was King of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and the [[British Dominions]] and [[Emperor of India]] from 22 January 1901 until his death.

The eldest son of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]], Edward was related to royalty throughout Europe. Before his accession to the throne, he served as [[heir apparent]] and held the title of [[Prince of Wales]] for longer than any of his predecessors. During the long reign of his mother, he was largely excluded from political power and came to personify the fashionable, leisured elite. He travelled throughout Britain performing ceremonial public duties and represented Britain on visits abroad. His tours of North America in 1860 and the Indian subcontinent in 1875 were popular successes, but his reputation as a playboy prince soured his relationship with his mother.

As king, Edward played a role in the modernisation of the [[British Home Fleet]] and the reorganisation of the [[British Army]] after the [[Second Boer War]]. He re-instituted traditional ceremonies as public displays and broadened the range of people with whom royalty socialised. He fostered good relations between Britain and other European countries, especially [[French Third Republic|France]], for which he was popularly called "Peacemaker", but his relationship with his nephew, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], was poor. The [[Edwardian era]], which covered Edward's reign and was named after him, coincided with the start of a new century and heralded significant changes in technology and society, including [[steam turbine]] propulsion and the rise of [[History of socialism in Great Britain|socialism]]. He died in 1910 in the midst of a constitutional crisis that was resolved the following year by the [[Parliament Act 1911]], which restricted the power of the unelected [[House of Lords]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:AlbertEdward.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, by [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter|Winterhalter]], 1846]]
Edward was born at 10:48 in the morning on 9 November 1841 in [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref>{{citation|last=Magnus|first=Philip|authorlink=Sir Philip Magnus-Allcroft, 2nd Baronet|title=King Edward The Seventh|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1964|page=1}}</ref> He was the eldest son and second child of [[Queen Victoria]] and her husband (and first cousin) [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. He was christened '''Albert Edward''' at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], on 25 January 1842.<ref>His godparents were [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|the King of Prussia]], [[Ernest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|his paternal grandfather]]'s wife [[Duchess Marie of Württemberg|the Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (for whom [[Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld|the Duchess of Kent]], his maternal grandmother, stood proxy), his great-uncle [[Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge|the Duke of Cambridge]], [[Augustus, Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg|his great-grandfather]]'s wife [[Princess Karoline Amalie of Hesse-Kassel|the Dowager Duchess of Saxe-Coburg-Altenburg]] (for whom [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel|the Duchess of Cambridge]], his great-aunt, stood proxy), his great-aunt [[Princess Sophia of the United Kingdom|the Princess Sophia]] (for whom [[Princess Augusta of Cambridge]], his first cousin once-removed, stood proxy) and his great-uncle [[Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] ({{London Gazette|issue=20065|date=28 January 1842|startpage=224}}).</ref> He was named Albert after his father and Edward after his maternal grandfather [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn]]. He was known as '''Bertie''' to the family throughout his life.<ref>{{citation|last=Bentley-Cranch|first=Dana|title=Edward VII: Image of an Era 1841–1910|publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office|location=London|year=1992|isbn=0-11-290508-0|page=1}}</ref>

As the eldest son of the British sovereign, he was automatically [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay]] at birth. As a son of Prince Albert, he also held the titles of [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] and [[Ernestine duchies|Duke of Saxony]]. He was created [[Prince of Wales]] and [[Earl of Chester]] on 8 December 1841, [[Earl of Dublin]] on 17 January 1850, a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] on 9 November 1858, and a [[Order of the Thistle|Knight of the Thistle]] on 24 May 1867.<ref>{{citation|last=Weir|first=Alison|authorlink=Alison Weir (historian)|title=Britain's Royal Families: The Complete Genealogy, Revised Edition|publisher=Random House|location=London|year=1996|isbn=0-7126-7448-9|page=319}}</ref> In 1863, he renounced his succession rights to the Duchy of [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] in favour of his younger brother, [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred]].<ref>[[John Van der Kiste|Van der Kiste, John]] (September 2004; online edition May 2007) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/346 "Alfred, Prince, duke of Edinburgh (1844–1900)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/346}}, retrieved 24 June 2009 {{ODNBsub}}</ref>

Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were determined that their eldest son should have an education that would prepare him to be a model [[constitutional monarch]]. At age seven, Edward embarked on a rigorous educational programme devised by Prince Albert, and supervised by several tutors. Unlike his elder sister [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]], Edward did not excel in his studies.<ref>{{citation|last=Ridley|first=Jane|year=2012|title=Bertie: A Life of Edward VII|publisher=Chatto & Windus|location=London|isbn=978-0-7011-7614-3|pages=17–19}}</ref> He tried to meet the expectations of his parents, but to no avail. Although Edward was not a diligent student—his true talents were those of charm, sociability and tact—[[Benjamin Disraeli]] described him as informed, intelligent and of sweet manner.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 4</ref>

After an educational trip to Rome, undertaken in the first few months of 1859, he spent the summer of that year studying at the [[University of Edinburgh]] under, amongst others, the chemist [[Lyon Playfair]]. In October, he matriculated as an undergraduate at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 18</ref> Now released from the educational strictures imposed by his parents, he enjoyed studying for the first time and performed satisfactorily in examinations.<ref name="dnb">[[Colin Matthew|Matthew, H.

==Early adulthood==
[[File:H.R.H. Prince of Wales and Suite at Point View, Niagara.jpg|thumb|right|Edward at [[Niagara Falls]], 1860]]
In 1860, Edward undertook the first tour of North America by an heir to the British throne. His genial good humour and confident ''bonhomie'' made the tour a great success.<ref name="bc">Bentley-Cranch, pp. 20–34</ref> He inaugurated the [[Victoria Bridge, Montreal]], across the [[St Lawrence River]], and laid the cornerstone of [[Parliament Hill, Ottawa]]. He watched [[Charles Blondin]] traverse [[Niagara Falls]] by highwire, and stayed for three days with President [[James Buchanan]] at the [[White House]]. Buchanan accompanied the Prince to [[Mount Vernon]], to pay his respects at the tomb of [[George Washington]]. Vast crowds greeted him everywhere. He met [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]]. Prayers for the royal family were said in [[Trinity Church, New York]], for the first time since 1776.<ref name="bc" /> The four-month tour throughout Canada and the United States considerably boosted Edward's confidence and self-esteem, and had many diplomatic benefits for Great Britain.<ref>Hough, pp. 39–47</ref>

Edward had hoped to pursue a career in the [[British Army]], but his mother vetoed an active military career.<ref>Ridley, p. 37</ref> His ranks were honorary; he was gazetted a lieutenant-colonel without experience or any examinations in 1858.<ref name="dnb"/> In September 1861, Edward was sent to Germany, supposedly to watch military manoeuvres, but actually in order to engineer a meeting between him and Princess [[Alexandra of Denmark]], the eldest daughter of [[Christian IX of Denmark|Prince Christian of Denmark]] and his wife [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Louise]]. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert had already decided that Edward and Alexandra should marry. They met at [[Speyer]] on 24 September under the auspices of his elder sister, [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Victoria]], who had married the [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Crown Prince of Prussia]] in 1858.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, pp. 36–38</ref> Edward's elder sister, acting upon instructions from their mother, had met Princess Alexandra at [[Neustrelitz|Strelitz]] in June; the young Danish princess made a very favourable impression. Edward and Alexandra were friendly from the start; the meeting went well for both sides, and marriage plans advanced.<ref>Hough, pp. 64–66</ref>

From this time, Edward gained a reputation as a playboy. Determined to get some army experience, Edward attended manoeuvres in Ireland, during which he spent three nights with an actress, [[Nellie Clifden]], who was hidden in the camp by his fellow officers.<ref>Ridley, pp. 54–55</ref> Prince Albert, though ill, was appalled and visited Edward at [[Cambridge]] to issue a reprimand. Albert died in December 1861 just two weeks after the visit. Queen Victoria was inconsolable, wore mourning clothes for the rest of her life and blamed Edward for his father's death.<ref>Ridley, pp. 59–63</ref> At first, she regarded her son with distaste as frivolous, indiscreet and irresponsible. She wrote to her eldest daughter, "I never can, or shall, look at him without a shudder."<ref>{{citation|last=Middlemas|first=Keith|coauthors=Edited by [[Antonia Fraser]]|title=The Life and Times of Edward VII|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|year=1972|page=31|isbn=0-297-83189-5}}</ref>

==Marriage==

{{See also|Wedding of Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, and Princess Alexandra of Denmark }}
Once widowed, Queen Victoria effectively withdrew from public life. Shortly after Prince Albert's death, she arranged for Edward to embark on an extensive tour of the Middle East, visiting [[Egypt]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Damascus]], [[Beirut]] and [[Istanbul|Constantinople]].<ref>Bentley-Cranch, pp. 40–42</ref> In part political, the [[British Government]] wanted Edward to secure the friendship of Egypt's ruler, [[Sa'id of Egypt|Said Pasha]], to prevent French control of the [[Suez Canal]] if the [[Ottoman Empire]] collapsed. It was the first [[Royal Tour]] on which an official photographer, [[Francis Bedford (photographer)|Francis Bedford]], was in attendance.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2279609/Banished-Holy-Land-notorious-sex-scandal-future-Edvard-VII-spent-days-smoking-shooting-crocodiles-drinking-coffee--returning-home-tattoo.html#ixzz2L8g3SQjd|title=The first EVER photographs of a Royal tour|author=Ridley, Jane|publisher=Mail Online|date=16 February 2013|accessdate=17 February 2013}}</ref> As soon as Edward returned to Britain, preparations were made for his engagement, which was sealed at [[Laeken]] in Belgium on 9 September 1862.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 44; Ridley, p. 72</ref> Edward married [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra of Denmark]] at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], on 10 March 1863. He was 21; she was 18.
[[File:King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra - Wedding -1863.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Edward and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Alexandra]] on their wedding day, 1863]]
Edward and his wife established [[Marlborough House]] as their London residence and [[Sandringham House]] in Norfolk as their country retreat. They entertained on a lavish scale. Their marriage met with disapproval in certain circles because most of Queen Victoria's relations were German, and Denmark was at loggerheads with Germany over the territories of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. When Alexandra's father inherited the throne of Denmark in November 1863, the [[German Confederation]] took the opportunity to [[Second Schleswig War|invade and annex Schleswig-Holstein]]. Queen Victoria was of two minds whether it was a suitable match given the political climate.<ref>Middlemas, p. 35; Ridley, p. 83</ref> After the couple's marriage, she expressed anxiety about their socialite lifestyle and attempted to dictate to them on various matters, including the names of their children.<ref>Ridley, pp. 85, 87, 93, 104</ref>

Edward had mistresses throughout his married life. He socialised with actress [[Lillie Langtry]]; [[Lady Randolph Churchill]] (born Jennie Jerome, she was the mother of [[Winston Churchill]]);<ref>Letters written by Edward to Lady Randolph may have "signified no more than a flirtation" but were "[w]ritten in a strain of undue familiarity" (Hattersley, p. 21).</ref> [[Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick]]; actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]]; noblewoman [[Lady Susan Vane-Tempest]]; singer [[Hortense Schneider]]; prostitute Giulia Beneni (known as "La Barucci"); wealthy humanitarian [[Agnes Keyser]]; and [[Alice Keppel]]. At least fifty-five liaisons are conjectured.<ref>{{citation|last=Camp|first=Anthony|title=Royal Mistresses and Bastards: Fact and Fiction, 1714–1936|year=2007}}. They are listed at http://anthonyjcamp.com/page9.htm.</ref> How far these relationships went is not always clear. Edward always strove to be discreet, but this did not prevent society gossip or press speculation.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 74–80</ref> One of Alice Keppel's great-granddaughters, [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla Parker Bowles]], became the mistress and subsequently wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], one of Edward's great-great-grandsons. It was rumoured that Camilla's grandmother, [[Sonia Cubitt, Baroness Ashcombe|Sonia Keppel]] (born in May 1900), was the illegitimate daughter of Edward, but she was "almost certainly" the daughter of [[George Keppel (soldier)|George Keppel]], whom she resembled.<ref>{{citation|first=Diana|last=Souhami|title=Mrs Keppel and Her Daughter|location=London|publisher=HarpurCollins|year=1996|page=49}}</ref> Edward never acknowledged any illegitimate children.<ref>{{citation|first=Mike|last=Ashley|authorlink=Mike Ashley (writer)|title=The Mammoth Book of British Kings and Queens|publisher=Robinson|location=London|year=1998|pages=694–695|isbn=1-84119-096-9}}</ref> Alexandra is believed to have been aware of many of his affairs and to have accepted them.<ref>Middlemas, p. 89</ref>

In 1869, [[Sir Charles Mordaunt, 10th Baronet|Sir Charles Mordaunt]], a British [[Member of Parliament#United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]], threatened to name Edward as co-respondent in his divorce suit. Ultimately, he did not do so but Edward was called as a witness in the case in early 1870. It was shown that Edward had visited the Mordaunts' house while Sir Charles was away sitting in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although nothing further was proven and Edward denied he had committed adultery, the suggestion of impropriety was damaging.<ref name="dnb" /><ref>Priestley, pp. 22–23</ref>

==Heir apparent==
During Queen Victoria's widowhood, Edward pioneered the idea of royal public appearances as we understand them today—for example, opening [[Thames Embankment]] in 1871, [[Mersey Railway|Mersey Tunnel]] in 1886, and [[Tower Bridge]] in 1894.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 97</ref> However, his mother did not allow Edward an active role in the running of the country until 1898.<ref name="royal">{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/HistoryoftheMonarchy/KingsandQueensoftheUnitedKingdom/Saxe-Coburg-Gotha/EdwardVII.aspx|title=Edward VII|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy|accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref><ref>Hattersley, pp. 18–19</ref> He was sent summaries of important government documents, but she refused to give him access to the originals.<ref name="dnb"/> He annoyed his mother by siding with Denmark on the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]] in 1864 (she was pro-German) and in the same year annoyed her again by making a special effort to meet [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].<ref>Bentley-Cranch, pp. 59–60</ref> [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] sent him papers secretly.<ref name="dnb"/>

In 1870 republican sentiment in Britain was given a boost when the French Emperor, [[Napoleon III]], was defeated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the [[French Third Republic]] was declared.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 66; Ridley, pp. 137, 142</ref> However, in the winter of 1871, a brush with death led to an improvement in both Edward's popularity with the public and his relationship with his mother. While staying at Londesborough Lodge, near [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire]], Edward contracted [[typhoid]], the disease that was believed to have killed his father. There was great national concern, and one of his fellow guests ([[George Stanhope, 7th Earl of Chesterfield|Lord Chesterfield]]) died. Edward's recovery was greeted with almost universal relief.<ref name="dnb" /> Public celebrations included the composition of [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s [[Festival Te Deum]]. Edward cultivated politicians from all parties, including republicans, as his friends, and thereby largely dissipated any residual feelings against him.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 67 and Middlemas, pp. 48–52</ref> From 1886, [[Foreign Secretary]] [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Lord Rosebery]] sent him Foreign Office despatches, and from 1892 some [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] papers were opened to him.<ref name="dnb"/>
[[File:Edward, Prince of Wales, with elephant, Terai cph.3b08927.jpg|thumb|right|Edward (front centre) in India, 1876]]
In October 1875 Edward set off for India on an extensive eight-month tour of the sub-continent. His advisors remarked on his habit of treating all people the same, regardless of their social station or colour. In letters home, he complained of the treatment of the native Indians by the British officials: "Because a man has a black face and a different religion from our own, there is no reason why he should be treated as a brute."<ref>Edward to [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville]], 30 November 1875, quoted in Bentley-Cranch, pp. 101–102 and Ridley, p. 179</ref> At the end of the tour, his mother was given the title Empress of India by Parliament, in part as a result of the tour's success.<ref name=bc104>Bentley-Cranch, p. 104</ref>

Edward was a patron of the arts and sciences and helped found the [[Royal College of Music]]. He opened the college in 1883 with the words, "Class can no longer stand apart from class&nbsp;... I claim for music that it produces that union of feeling which I much desire to promote."<ref name=bc104/> At the same time, he enjoyed gambling and country sports and was an enthusiastic hunter. He ordered all the clocks at Sandringham to run half an hour ahead to provide more daylight time for shooting. This so-called tradition of [[Sandringham Time]] continued until 1936, when it was abolished by [[Edward VIII]].<ref name="duke">{{citation|last=Windsor|first=HRH The Duke of|authorlink=Edward VIII|title=A King's Story|publisher=Cassell and Co|location=London|year=1951|page=46}}</ref> He also laid out a golf course at Windsor. By the 1870s the future king had taken a keen interest in horseracing and steeplechasing. In 1896, his horse [[Persimmon (horse)|Persimmon]] won both the [[Epsom Derby|Derby Stakes]] and the [[St. Leger Stakes]]. In 1900, Persimmon's brother, [[Diamond Jubilee (horse)|Diamond Jubilee]], won five races (Derby, St. Leger, [[2,000 Guineas Stakes]], [[Newmarket Stakes]] and [[Eclipse Stakes]])<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 110</ref> and another of Edward's horses, Ambush II, won the [[Grand National]].<ref>Middlemas, p. 98</ref>

He was regarded worldwide as an arbiter of men's fashions.<ref>{{citation|last=Bergner Hurlock|first=Elizabeth|title=The psychology of dress: an analysis of fashion and its motive|publisher=Ayer Publishing|year=1976|isbn=978-0-405-08644-1|page=108}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last=Mansel|first=Philip|authorlink=Philip Mansel|title=Dressed to Rule|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=138|year=2005|isbn=0-300-10697-1}}</ref> He made wearing [[Tweed (cloth)|tweed]], [[Homburg hat]]s and [[Norfolk jacket]]s fashionable, and popularised the wearing of black ties with dinner jackets, instead of [[white tie]] and tails.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 84</ref> He pioneered the pressing of trouser legs from side to side in preference to the now normal front and back creases,<ref>Middlemas, p. 201</ref> and was thought to have introduced the stand-up turn-down shirt collar.<ref>{{citation|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=OW18981103.2.164|title=Try our "98' Curzons!"

In 1891 Edward was embroiled in the [[royal baccarat scandal]], when it was revealed he had played an illegal card game for money the previous year. The Prince was forced to appear as a witness in court for a second time when one of the players unsuccessfully sued his fellow players for slander after being accused of cheating.<ref>Hattersley, pp. 23–25; Ridley, pp. 280–290</ref> In the same year Edward was involved in a personal conflict, when [[Lord Charles Beresford]] threatened to reveal details of Edward's private life to the press, as a protest against Edward interfering with Beresford's affair with [[Daisy Greville, Countess of Warwick]]. The friendship between the two men was irreversibly damaged and their bitterness would last for the remainder of their lives.<ref>Middlemas, p. 86; Ridley, pp. 265–268</ref> Usually, Edward's outbursts of temper were short-lived, and "after he had let himself go&nbsp;... [he would] smooth matters by being especially nice".<ref>Sir [[Frederick Ponsonby, 1st Baron Sysonby]], quoted in Middlemas, p. 188</ref>

In late 1891 Edward's eldest son, Albert Victor, was engaged to [[Mary of Teck|Princess Victoria Mary of Teck]]. Just a few weeks later, in early 1892, Albert Victor died of pneumonia. Edward was grief-stricken. "To lose our eldest son", he wrote, "is one of those calamities one can never really get over". Edward told Queen Victoria, "[I would] have given my life for him, as I put no value on mine".<ref>Middlemas, pp. 95–96</ref> Albert Victor was the second of Edward's children to die. In 1871, his youngest son, John, had died just 24 hours after being born. Edward had insisted on placing John in his coffin personally with "the tears rolling down his cheeks".<ref>Letter from Mrs Elise Stonor to Queen Victoria, 11 April 1871, quoted in Battiscombe, p. 112 and Ridley, p. 140</ref>

On his way to Denmark through Belgium on 4 April 1900 Edward was the victim of an attempted assassination, when fifteen-year-old [[Jean-Baptiste Sipido]] shot at him in protest over the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]]. Sipido, although obviously guilty, was acquitted by a Belgian court because he was underage.<ref>Ridley, pp. 339–340</ref> The perceived laxity of the Belgian authorities, combined with British disgust at Belgian atrocities in the [[Belgian Congo|Congo]], worsened the already poor relationship between the United Kingdom and the Continent. However, in the next ten years, Edward's affability and popularity, as well as his use of family connections, assisted Britain in building European alliances.<ref>Middlemas, p. 65</ref>

==Accession==

When Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, Edward became King of the United Kingdom, Emperor of India and, in an innovation, King of the [[British Dominions]].<ref>Lee, vol. II, p. 7; Middlemas, p. 104</ref> He chose to reign under the name Edward VII, instead of Albert Edward—the name his mother had intended for him to use,<ref>No English or British sovereign has ever reigned under a double name.</ref> declaring that he did not wish to "undervalue the name of Albert" and diminish the status of his father with whom the "name should stand alone".<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27270|date=23 January 1901|startpage=547|supp=y}}</ref> The number VII was occasionally omitted in Scotland, even by the [[Church of Scotland|national church]], in deference to protests that the previous Edwards were English kings who had "been excluded from Scotland by battle".<ref name="dnb" /> [[J. B. Priestley]] recalled, "I was only a child when he succeeded Victoria in 1901, but I can testify to his extraordinary popularity. He was in fact the most popular king England had known since the earlier 1660s."<ref>Priestley, p. 9</ref>

He donated his parents' house, [[Osborne House|Osborne]] on the [[Isle of Wight]], to the state and continued to live at Sandringham.<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 14</ref> He could afford to be magnanimous; his private secretary, Sir [[Francis Knollys, 1st Viscount Knollys|Francis Knollys]], claimed that he was the first heir to succeed to the throne in credit.<ref>Lee, vol.

Edward VII was crowned at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Frederick Temple]], who died only four months later. The coronation had originally been scheduled for 26 June, but two days before on 24 June, Edward was diagnosed with [[appendicitis]].<ref>Lee, vol. II, pp. 102–109</ref> Appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in [[anaesthesia]] and [[antisepsis]] in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible.<ref name="app">{{citation|author=Mirilas, P. ; Skandalakis, J.E.|year=2003|title=Not just an appendix: Sir Frederick Treves|journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood|volume=88|pages=549–552|doi=10.1136/adc.88.6.549|pmid=12765932|issue=6|pmc=1763108}}</ref> Sir [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Frederick Treves]], with the support of [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Lord Lister]], performed a then-radical operation of draining the infected abscess through a small incision. The next day, Edward was sitting up in bed, smoking a cigar.<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 20</ref> Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation)<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 127</ref> and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream.<ref name="app"/>

Edward refurbished the royal palaces, reintroduced the traditional ceremonies, such as the [[State Opening of Parliament]], that his mother had forgone, and founded new [[Order (honour)|orders of honours]], such as the [[Order of Merit]], to recognise contributions to the arts and sciences.<ref>Bentley-Cranch, pp. 122–139; Ridley, pp. 351–352, 361, 372</ref> In 1902, the Shah of Persia, [[Mozzafar al-Din Shah|Mozzafar-al-Din]], visited England expecting to receive the [[Order of the Garter]]. Edward refused to give this high honour to the Shah because the order was meant to be his personal gift and the [[Foreign Secretary]], [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], had promised the order without his consent. Edward also objected to inducting a Muslim into a Christian order of chivalry. His refusal threatened to damage British attempts to gain influence in Persia,<ref>Hattersley, pp. 39–40</ref> but Edward resented his ministers' attempts to reduce the King's traditional powers.<ref>Lee, vol. II, p. 182</ref> Eventually, he relented and Britain sent a special embassy to the Shah with a full Order of the Garter the following year.<ref>Lee, vol. II, p. 157; Middlemas, pp. 125–126</ref>

=="Uncle of Europe"==
[[File:EdwardVII at Balmoral.jpg|thumbnail|right|Edward VII relaxing at [[Balmoral Castle]], photographed by his wife, Alexandra]]
As king, Edward's main interests lay in the fields of foreign affairs and naval and military matters. Fluent in French and German, he made a number of visits abroad, and took annual holidays in [[Biarritz]] and [[Marienbad]].<ref name="duke" /> One of his most important foreign trips was an official visit to France in May 1903 as the guest of President [[Émile Loubet]]. Following a visit to the [[Pope Leo XIII|Pope]] in Rome, this trip helped create the atmosphere for the Anglo-French [[Entente Cordiale]], an agreement delineating British and French colonies in North Africa, and ruling out any future war between the two countries. The Entente was negotiated between the French foreign minister, [[Théophile Delcassé]], and the British foreign secretary, [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]]. Signed in London on 8 April 1904 by Lansdowne and the French ambassador [[Paul Cambon]], it marked the end of centuries of Anglo-French rivalry and Britain's [[splendid isolation]] from Continental affairs, and attempted to counterbalance the growing dominance of the [[German Empire]] and its ally, [[Austria-Hungary]].<ref>{{citation|author=Nicolson, Harold|authorlink=Harold Nicolson|date=October 1954|title=The Origins and Development of the Anglo-French Entente|journal=International Affairs|publisher=[[Royal Institute of International Affairs]]|volume=XXX|issue=4|pages=407–416}}</ref>

Edward was related to nearly every other European monarch and came to be known as the "uncle of Europe".<ref name="royal" /> [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] was his nephew; [[Tsar Nicholas II]] was his nephew-by-marriage; [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg|Queen Victoria Eugenia of Spain]], [[Princess Margaret of Connaught|Crown Princess Margaret of Sweden]], [[Marie of Romania|Crown Princess Marie of Romania]], [[Sophia of Prussia|Crown Princess Sophia of Greece]], and [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra of Russia]] were his nieces; [[Haakon VII of Norway]] was both his nephew by marriage and his son-in-law; [[George I of Greece]] and [[Frederick VIII of Denmark]] were his brothers-in-law; [[Albert I of Belgium]], [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]], and [[Charles I of Portugal|Charles I]] and [[Manuel II of Portugal]] were his second cousins. Edward doted on his grandchildren, and indulged them, to the consternation of their governesses.<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 15</ref> However, there was one relation whom Edward did not like: Wilhelm II. Edward's difficult relationship with his nephew exacerbated the tensions between Germany and Britain.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 60–61, 172–175; Hattersley, pp. 460–464</ref>

In April 1908, during Edward's annual stay at Biarritz, he accepted the resignation of British Prime Minister Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]]. In a break with precedent, Edward asked Campbell-Bannerman's successor, [[H. H. Asquith]], to travel to Biarritz to [[kiss hands]]. Asquith complied, but the press criticised the action of the King in appointing a prime minister on foreign soil instead of returning to Britain.<ref>Lee, vol. II, pp. 581–582</ref> In June 1908, Edward became the first reigning British monarch to visit the [[Russian Empire]], despite refusing to visit in 1906, when Anglo-Russian relations were strained in the aftermath of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], the [[Dogger Bank incident]], and the Tsar's dissolution of the [[Duma]].<ref>Middlemas, pp. 167, 169</ref> The previous month, Edward visited the Scandinavian countries, becoming the first British monarch to visit Sweden.<ref>Lee, vol. II, pp. 583–584</ref>

==Political opinions==
[[File:King Edward VII Vanity Fair 19 June 1902.jpg|thumb|right|Edward depicted in naval uniform by ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine, 1902]]
Edward involved himself heavily in discussions over army reform, the need for which had become apparent with the failings of the [[Second Boer War]]. He supported the redesign of army command, the creation of the [[Territorial Force]], and the decision to provide an Expeditionary Force supporting France in the event of war with Germany.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 130–134</ref> Reform of the Royal Navy was also suggested, partly due to the ever-increasing Naval Estimates, and because of the emergence of the [[Kaiserliche Marine|Imperial German Navy]] as a new strategic threat.<ref>{{citation|last=Kennedy|first=Paul M.|authorlink=Paul Kennedy|title=The Rise and Fall of British Naval Mastery|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|year=2004|pages=215–216}}</ref> Ultimately a dispute arose between Admiral [[Lord Charles Beresford]], who favoured increased spending and a broad deployment, and the [[First Sea Lord]] Admiral Sir [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|John Fisher]], who favoured efficiency savings, scrapping obsolete vessels, and a strategic realignment of the Royal Navy relying on torpedo craft for home defence backed by the new [[dreadnought]]s.<ref>See, principally, {{citation|last=Lambert|first=Nicholas A.|title=Sir John Fisher's Naval Revolution|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, South Carolina|year=2002|isbn=1-57003-492-3}} For a much shorter summary of Fisher's reforms, see {{citation|last=Grove|first=Eric J.|authorlink=Eric Grove|title=The Royal Navy since 1815|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Basingstoke|year=2005|isbn=0-333-72126-8|pages=88–100}}</ref>

The King lent support to Fisher, in part because he disliked Beresford, and eventually Beresford was dismissed. Beresford continued his campaign outside of the navy and Fisher ultimately announced his resignation in late 1909, although the bulk of his policies were retained.<ref>Middlemas, pp. 134–139</ref> The King was intimately involved in the appointment of Fisher's successor as the Fisher-Beresford feud had split the service, and the only truly qualified figure known to be outside of both camps was [[Arthur Wilson (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson]], who had retired in 1907.<ref>Lambert, pp. 200–201.</ref> Wilson was reluctant to return to active duty, but Edward persuaded him to do so, and Wilson became First Sea Lord on 25 January 1910.<ref>{{citation|last=Bradford|first=Admiral Sir Edward E.|authorlink=Edward Eden Bradford|title=Life of Admiral of the Fleet Sir Arthur Knyvet Wilson|publisher=John Murray|location=London|year=1923|pages=223–225}}</ref>

As Prince of Wales, Edward had come to enjoy warm and mutually respectful relations with [[William Ewart Gladstone|W. E. Gladstone]], whom his mother detested.<ref>Magnus, p. 212</ref> But Gladstone's son, [[Home Secretary]] [[Herbert Gladstone]], angered the King by planning to permit Roman Catholic priests in vestments to carry the Host through the streets of London, and by appointing two ladies, Lady Frances Balfour and Mrs [[Harold Tennant|H. J. Tennant]], to serve on a Royal Commission on reforming divorce law – Edward thought divorce could not be discussed with "delicacy or even decency" before ladies. Edward's biographer [[Sir Philip Magnus-Allcroft, 2nd Baronet|Philip Magnus]] suggests that Gladstone may have become a whipping-boy for the King's general irritation with the Liberal government. Gladstone was sacked in the reshuffle the following year and the King agreed, with some reluctance, to appoint him [[Governor-General of South Africa]].<ref>Magnus, p. 541</ref>

Edward was rarely interested in politics, although his views on some issues were notably liberal for the time. During his reign he said use of the word ''[[nigger]]'' was "disgraceful" despite it then being in common parlance.<ref>{{citation|last=Rose|first=Kenneth|authorlink=Kenneth Rose|title=King George V|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|year=1983|page=65}}</ref> While Prince of Wales, he had to be dissuaded from breaking with constitutional precedent by openly voting for [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Representation of the People Bill (1884)]] in the [[House of Lords]]. On other matters he was less progressive: he did not, for example, favour giving [[Women's suffrage|votes to women]],<ref name="dnb" /><ref>Hattersley, pp. 215–216</ref> although he did suggest that the social reformer [[Octavia Hill]] serve on the [[Housing of the Working Classes Act 1885#Background|Commission for Working Class Housing]].<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 98</ref> He was also opposed to [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Irish Home Rule]], instead preferring a form of [[dual monarchy]].<ref name="dnb" /> Edward lived a life of luxury that was often far removed from that of the majority of his subjects. However, his personal charm with people at all levels of society and his strong condemnation of prejudice went some way to assuage republican and racial tensions building during his lifetime.<ref name="dnb" />

==Constitutional crisis==
[[File:Francis Derwent Wood - Edouard VII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust by [[Francis Derwent Wood]]]]
[[File:Edward VII Halfpenny.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Profile of Edward VII on a [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|half-penny]], 1902]]
In the last year of his life, Edward became embroiled in a constitutional crisis when the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] majority in the [[House of Lords]] refused to pass the "[[People's Budget]]" proposed by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] government of Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]]. The crisis eventually led – after Edward's death – to the removal of the Lords' right to veto legislation.

The King was displeased at Liberal attacks on the peers, which included a polemic speech by [[David Lloyd George]] at [[Limehouse]].<ref>Heffer, pp. 276–277; Ridley, p. 437</ref> Cabinet minister [[Winston Churchill]] publicly demanded a general election, for which Asquith apologised to the King's adviser [[Francis Knollys, 1st Viscount Knollys|Lord Knollys]] and rebuked Churchill at a Cabinet meeting. Edward was so depressed at the tone of class warfare – although Asquith told him that party rancour had been just as bad over the [[First Home Rule Bill]] in 1886 – that he introduced his son to [[Secretary of State for War]] [[Richard Haldane]] as "the last King of England".<ref>Heffer, pp. 282–283</ref> After the King's horse Minoru won the Derby on 26 July 1909, he returned to the racetrack the following day, and laughed when a man shouted: "Now, King. You've won the Derby. Go back home and dissolve this bloody Parliament!"<ref>Magnus, p. 526</ref>

In vain, the King urged Conservative leaders [[Arthur Balfour]] and [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]] to pass the Budget, which [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] had advised him was not unusual, as Queen Victoria had helped to broker agreements between the two Houses over [[Irish Church Act 1869|Irish disestablishment in 1869]] and the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act in 1884]].<ref>Magnus, p. 534; Ridley, pp. 440–441</ref> On Asquith's advice, however, he did not offer them an election (at which, to judge from recent by-elections, they were likely to gain seats) as a reward for doing so.<ref>Heffer, pp. 281–282</ref>

The Finance Bill passed the Commons on 5 November 1909 but was rejected by the Lords on 30 November; they instead passed a resolution of Lord Lansdowne's stating that they were entitled to oppose the bill as it lacked an electoral mandate. The King was annoyed that his efforts to urge passage of the budget had become public knowledge<ref>Magnus, p. 536</ref> and had forbidden his adviser Lord Knollys, who was an active Liberal peer, from voting for the budget, although Knollys had suggested that this would be a suitable gesture to indicate royal desire to see the Budget pass.<ref>Heffer, pp. 283–284</ref> In December 1909, a proposal to create peers (to give the Liberals a majority in the Lords) or give the prime minister the right to do so was considered "outrageous" by Knollys, who thought the King should abdicate rather than agree to it.<ref>Ridley, p. 443</ref>

The [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|January 1910 election]] was dominated by talk of removing the Lords' veto. During the election campaign Lloyd George talked of "guarantees" and Asquith of "safeguards" that would be necessary before forming another Liberal government, but the King informed Asquith that he would not be willing to contemplate creating peers until after a second general election.<ref name="dnb" /><ref>Hattersley, p. 168</ref> Balfour refused to be drawn on whether or not he would be willing to form a Conservative government, but advised the King not to promise to create peers until he had seen the terms of any proposed constitutional change.<ref name="Heffer, pp. 286–288">Heffer, pp. 286–288</ref> During the campaign the leading Conservative [[Walter Long, 1st Viscount Long|Walter Long]] had asked Knollys for permission to state that the King did not favour Irish Home Rule, but Knollys refused, as it was not appropriate for the monarch's views to be known in public.<ref name="Magnus, p. 547">Magnus, p. 547</ref>

The [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]], with the Liberal government dependent on the support of the third largest party, the [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]]. The King suggested a compromise whereby only 50 peers from each side would be allowed to vote, which would also redress the large Conservative majority in the Lords, but [[Robert Crewe-Milnes, 1st Marquess of Crewe|Lord Crewe]], Liberal leader in the Lords, advised that this would reduce the Lords' independence as only peers who were loyal party supporters would be picked.<ref name="Magnus, p. 547"/> Pressure to remove the Lords' veto now came from the Irish nationalist MPs, who wanted to remove the Lords' ability to block the introduction of Irish Home Rule. They threatened to vote against the Budget unless they had their way (an attempt by Lloyd George to win their support by amending whisky duties was abandoned as the Cabinet felt this would recast the Budget too much). Asquith now revealed that there were no "guarantees" for the creation of peers. The Cabinet considered resigning and leaving it up to Balfour to try to form a Conservative government.<ref>Heffer, pp. 290–293</ref>

The King's [[Speech from the Throne]] on 21 February made reference to introducing measures restricting the Lords' power of veto to one of delay, but Asquith inserted a phrase "in the opinion of my advisers" so the King could be seen to be distancing himself from the planned legislation.<ref>Heffer, p. 291</ref>

The Commons passed resolutions on 14 April that would form the basis for the [[Parliament Act 1911|Parliament Act]]: to remove the power of the Lords to veto money bills, to replace their veto of other bills with a power to delay, and to reduce the term of Parliament from seven years to five (the King would have preferred four<ref name="Heffer, pp. 286–288"/>). But in that debate Asquith hinted – to ensure the support of the nationalist MPs – that he would ask the King to break the deadlock "in that Parliament" (i.e. contrary to Edward's earlier stipulation that there be a second election). The Budget was passed by both Commons and Lords in April.<ref>Heffer, p. 293</ref>

By April the Palace was having secret talks with Balfour and the Archbishop of Canterbury, who both advised that the Liberals did not have sufficient mandate to demand the creation of peers. The King thought the whole proposal "simply disgusting" and that the government was "in the hands of [[John Redmond|Redmond]] & Co". Lord Crewe announced publicly that the government's wish to create peers should be treated as formal "ministerial advice" (which, by convention, the monarch must obey) although Lord Esher argued that the monarch was entitled ''in extremis'' to dismiss the government rather than take their "advice".<ref>Heffer, pp. 294–296</ref> Esher's view has been called "obsolete and unhelpful".<ref>Magnus, pp. 555–556</ref>

==Death==
{{further|Funeral of Edward VII}}
[[File:4125s2.ogv|thumb|[[Funeral of Edward VII|Funeral procession of King Edward VII]], London, 1910]]
Edward habitually smoked twenty cigarettes and twelve cigars a day. Towards the end of his life he increasingly suffered from [[bronchitis]].<ref name="dnb" /> He suffered a momentary loss of consciousness during a state visit to Berlin in February 1909.<ref>Lee, vol. II, p. 676; Ridley, p. 432</ref> In March 1910, the King was staying at [[Biarritz]] when he collapsed. He remained there to convalesce, while in London Asquith tried to get the Finance Bill passed. The King's continued ill health was unreported and he attracted criticism for staying in France whilst political tensions were so high.<ref name="dnb" /> On 27 April he returned to Buckingham Palace, still suffering from severe bronchitis. Alexandra returned from visiting her brother, King [[George I of Greece]], in [[Corfu]] a week later on 5 May.

The following day, the King suffered several heart attacks, but refused to go to bed saying, "No, I shall not give in; I shall go on; I shall work to the end."<ref name="p151">Bentley-Cranch, p. 151</ref> Between moments of faintness, the Prince of Wales (shortly to be [[George V|King George V]]) told him that his horse, Witch of the Air, had won at [[Kempton Park Racecourse|Kempton Park]] that afternoon. The King replied, "Yes, I have heard of it. I am very glad": his [[last words|final words]].<ref name="dnb" /> At 11:30&nbsp;p.m. he lost consciousness for the last time and was put to bed. He died 15 minutes later.<ref name="p151" />

Edward VII was buried at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], on 20 May 1910. As [[Barbara Tuchman]] noted in ''[[The Guns of August]]'', [[Funeral of Edward VII|his funeral]] marked "the greatest assemblage of royalty and rank ever gathered in one place and, of its kind, the last".

Statues of Edward can be found throughout the former empire, such as those in Waterloo Place, London; [[Centenary Square|Centenary Square, Birmingham]]; [[Union Street, Aberdeen]]; [[Queen's Park (Toronto)|Queen's Park, Toronto]]; [[Phillips Square|Phillips Square, Montreal]]; [[North Terrace, Adelaide]]; Franklin Square, [[Hobart]]; and outside the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney]].

Before his accession to the throne, Edward was the longest-serving [[heir apparent]] in British history, until surpassed by his great-great-grandson [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], on 22 April 2011. As the title [[Prince of Wales]] is not exactly coincident with the position of heir apparent, he remains the longest-serving holder of that title, at 59 years, 45 days; Charles has held the title for {{Age in years and days|1958|07|26}}.

As king, Edward VII proved a greater success than anyone had expected, but he was already an old man and had little time left to fulfil the role. In his short reign, he ensured that his second son and heir, George V, was better prepared to take the throne. Contemporaries described their relationship as more like affectionate brothers than father and son,<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 155</ref> and on Edward's death George wrote in his diary that he had lost his "best friend and the best of fathers&nbsp;... I never had a [cross] word with him in my life. I am heart-broken and overwhelmed with grief".<ref>King George V's diary, 6 May 1910. Royal Archives</ref>

Edward was lauded as "Peacemaker",<ref>Bentley-Cranch, p. 157; Lee, vol. II, p. 738</ref> but had been afraid that his nephew, the German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], would tip Europe into war.<ref>Lee, vol. II, pp. 358, 650, 664; Middlemas, pp. 176, 179; Ridley, p. 474</ref> Four years after Edward's death, World War I broke out. The naval reforms he had supported and his part in securing the [[Triple Entente]] between Britain, France and Russia, as well as his relationships with his extended family, fed the paranoia of the German Emperor, who blamed Edward for the war.<ref>Ridley, p. 474</ref> Publication of the official biography of Edward was delayed by its author, [[Sidney Lee]], who feared German propagandists would select material to portray Edward as an anti-German warmonger.<ref>Ridley, p. 487</ref> Lee was also hampered by the extensive destruction of Edward's personal papers; Edward had left orders that all his letters should be burned on his death.<ref>Ridley, pp. 482–483</ref> Subsequent biographers have been able to construct a more rounded picture of Edward by using material and sources that were unavailable to Lee.<ref>Ridley, pp. 494–495</ref>

Edward received criticism for his apparent pursuit of self-indulgent pleasure but he received great praise for his affable and kind good manners, and his diplomatic skill. As his grandson wrote, "his lighter side&nbsp;... obscured the fact that he had both insight and influence."<ref>The Duke of Windsor, p. 69</ref> "He had a tremendous zest for pleasure but he also had a real sense of duty", wrote J. B. Priestley.<ref>Priestley, p. 25</ref> [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Lord Esher]] wrote that Edward was "kind and debonair and not undignified – but too human".<ref>Hattersley, p. 17</ref>
