While studying at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], Princess Beatrice was not expected to undertake regular royal duties, although she did make appearances at some events; for instance, she and her sister, [[Princess Eugenie of York|Princess Eugenie]], represented their father at a service of thanksgiving for her aunt, [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], in 2007.

In an interview to mark her 18th birthday, Beatrice said that she wanted to use her position to assist others through charity work; she had already undertaken charitable duties alongside her mother through the various organisations the Duchess supported. In 2002, Beatrice visited HIV-infected children in [[Russia]], and, in Britain, she supported Springboard for Children (a literacy project for primary-school children with learning difficulties) and [[Teenage Cancer Trust|the Teenage Cancer Trust]]. During the summer of 2008, Beatrice volunteered as a sales assistant at [[Selfridges]], and it was reported Beatrice and a friend had plans to found a fashion label.<ref>{{Cite news| last=Nicholl| first=Katie| title=Princess Bea the style queen... she can't get it from Mum!| newspaper=Daily Mail| date=8 September 2007| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=480726&in_page_id=1773|archivedate=5 August 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110805113925/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-480726/Princess-Bea-style-queen--Mum.html| postscript=.| location=London}}</ref> In April 2010, running to raise money for [[Children in Crisis]], she became the first member of the Royal Family to complete the [[London Marathon]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/7632312/Princess-Beatrice-becomes-first-royal-to-complete-London-Marathon.html |title=Princess Beatrice becomes first royal to complete London Marathon |publisher=[[Daily Telegraph#Website|Telegraph.co.uk]] |date=25 April 2010 |author=Matthew Moore}}</ref>

Beatrice has also been involved in the film industry, becoming the first member of the Royal Family to appear in a non-documentary film when she made a brief non-speaking appearance as an "extra" in ''[[The Young Victoria]]'' (2009), based around the accession and early reign of Beatrice's ancestor, [[Queen Victoria]].

==Official duties==

[[File:Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Princess Beatrice with her sister at [[Trooping the Colour]], June 2013.]]

Beatrice has been present at a number of official Royal occasions, such as [[Trooping the Colour]] in London, and [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]]'s eightieth birthday. She and her sister were also guests at the [[Concert for Diana]], in memory of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|their late aunt]] organised by their cousins, Princes [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William]] and [[Prince Harry|Harry]]. Both princesses attended the service of thanksgiving for Diana on 1 September 2007, representing their father, who was on an official visit to [[Malaysia]]. Beatrice was present at the wedding of her cousin [[Peter Phillips]] to [[Autumn Kelly]] in 2008, and the [[wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton]]. At the wedding, Beatrice's hat designed by [[Philip Treacy]] was remarked upon by some as an odd choice of fashion. Nonetheless, in May 2011, the hat was offered for sale on the internet auction site [[eBay]] with the proceeds going to charity:<ref name="newscore2011">Newscore (11 May 2011).

Princess Beatrice performed her highest profile royal duties to date when she accompanied her grandmother, the Queen, to the traditional [[Royal Maundy]] services on 5 April 2012.  Other than the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], she was the sole member of the Royal Family to attend the [[Maundy Thursday]] services at [[York Minster]] with the Queen.  There, Beatrice interacted with parishioners, received flowers from the public, and assisted the Queen as she passed out the official Maundy money to the pensioners.<ref>{{cite news|title=Princess Beatrice helps queen with Maundy Thursday tradition |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-57410121-10391698/princess-beatrice-helps-queen-with-maundy-thursday-tradition/ |work=[[Mary-Jayne McKay]]|work=CBS News|location=United States|date=5 April 2012 |accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref> In the lead up to the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] Princess Beatrice welcomed the Olympic flame on the steps of [[Harewood House]] near [[Leeds]].<ref>https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=444078168947352&set=a.444078162280686.99554.151274568227715&type=1&theater</ref>

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==

===Titles and styles===

While the announcement of the Princess's name as Beatrice was made some two weeks after her birth, she was from birth a [[British princess]] entitled to the style of Royal Highness. Her style and title in full is: ''Her Royal Highness Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary of York''. She has no official surname, but she uses the name of the area over which her father holds title, i.e. ''York'' (as [[Prince Harry]] – who is formally Prince Henry of Wales – uses ''Wales'', per his father, [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]). Upon her marriage, if applicable, she will have the option of taking her husband's surname/title, although she will independently retain her royal status (and be styled HRH) throughout her life.

It can also be considered a pun on the name Beatrice, an unusual example of [[Canting arms|canting]] in modern royal arms.
