Titan is the sixth [[hydrostatic equilibrium|ellipsoidal]] moon from Saturn. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan has a diameter roughly 50% larger than [[Moon|Earth's moon]] and is 80% more [[mass]]ive. It is the [[List of natural satellites by diameter|second-largest moon]] in the [[Solar System]], after [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], and it is larger by volume than the smallest planet, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], although only half as massive.

The moon itself is primarily composed of water ice and rocky material. Much as with [[Venus]] prior to the [[Space Age]], the dense, opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan's surface until new information accumulated with the arrival of the ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' mission in 2004, including the discovery of liquid [[hydrocarbon]] lakes in the satellite's polar regions. These are the only large, stable bodies of surface liquid known to exist anywhere other than [[Earth]]. The surface is geologically young; although mountains and several possible [[cryovolcano]]es have been discovered, it is smooth and few [[impact crater]]s have been discovered.

The atmosphere of Titan is largely composed of nitrogen; minor components lead to the formation of methane and [[ethane]] clouds and nitrogen-rich organic smog. The climate—including wind and rain—creates surface features similar to those of Earth, such as sand dunes, rivers, lakes and seas (probably of liquid methane or ethane) and shorelines, and, like on Earth, is dominated by seasonal weather patterns. With its liquids (both surface and subsurface) and robust nitrogen atmosphere, Titan is viewed as analogous to the early Earth, although at a much lower temperature. The satellite has thus been cited as a possible host for [[Microorganism|microbial]] [[extraterrestrial life]] or, at least, as a prebiotic environment rich in complex organic chemistry. Researchers have suggested a possible underground liquid ocean might serve as a biotic environment.<ref name=Grasset2000>

==Discovery and naming==
[[File:Christiaan Huygens-painting.jpeg|thumb|left|130px|Christiaan Huygens discovered Titan in 1655.]]

Titan was discovered on March 25, 1655, by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] astronomer Christiaan Huygens. Huygens was inspired by [[Galileo]]'s discovery of Jupiter's four [[Galilean moons|largest moons]] in 1610 and his improvements on [[telescope]] technology.<ref>

Christiaan Huygens discovered this first observed moon orbiting Saturn with the first telescope they built.<ref>[http://www.museumboerhaave.nl/collectie/e_voorwerpen/telescoopHuygens.html Telescope by Huygens, Christiaan Huygens, The Hague, 1683 Inv V09196], Rijksmuseum voor de Geschiedenis van de Natuurwetenschappen en van de Geneeskunde</ref>

He named it simply ''Saturni Luna'' (or ''Luna Saturni'', Latin for "Saturn's moon"), publishing in the 1655 tract ''De Saturni Luna Observatio Nova''. After [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] published his discoveries of four more moons of Saturn between 1673 and 1686, astronomers fell into the habit of referring to these and Titan as Saturn I through V (with Titan then in fourth position). Other early epithets for Titan include "Saturn's ordinary satellite".<ref>

The name ''Titan'', and the names of all seven satellites of Saturn then known, come from [[John Herschel]] (son of [[William Herschel]], discoverer of [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] and [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]]) in his 1847 publication ''Results of Astronomical Observations Made at the Cape of Good Hope''.<ref>

==Orbit and rotation==
[[File:Titan's orbit.svg|thumb|Titan's orbit (highlighted in red) among the other large inner moons of Saturn. The moons outside its orbit are (l-r) Iapetus and Hyperion; those inside are Rhea, Dione, Tethys, Enceladus, and Mimas.]]

Titan orbits Saturn once every 15 days and 22 hours. Like the Earth's moon and many of the other gas giant satellites, its orbital period is identical to its rotational period; Titan is thus [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] in [[synchronous rotation]] with Saturn, and thus always shows one face to the planet. Because of this, there is a sub-Saturnian point on its surface, from which the planet would appear to hang directly overhead. Longitudes on Titan are measured westward from the meridian passing through this point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evs-islands.com/2008/02/titans-unnamed-methane-sea.html|title=EVS-Islands: Titan's Unnamed Methane Sea|accessdate=22 October 2009}}</ref> Its orbital eccentricity is 0.0288, and it is inclined 0.348 degrees relative to the Saturnian equator.<ref name=horizons>Unless otherwise specified: {{cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi#top |title=JPL HORIZONS solar system data and ephemeris computation service |work=Solar System Dynamics|publisher=NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory |accessdate=2007-08-19}}</ref><!-- As http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_elem shows, that's 0.28° to the local Laplace plane, itself inclined 0.6° to Saturn's equator; an example of the calculation required to get the number shown here is given at [[Talk:Phoebe (moon)]] --> Viewed from Earth, the moon reaches an angular distance of about 20 Saturn radii (just over 1.2 million kilometers) from Saturn and subtends a disk 0.8 [[arcsecond]]s in diameter.

Titan is locked in a 3:4 [[orbital resonance]] with the small, irregularly shaped satellite [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]]. A "slow and smooth" evolution of the resonance—in which Hyperion would have migrated from a chaotic orbit—is considered unlikely, based on models. Hyperion probably formed in a stable orbital island, while massive Titan absorbed or ejected bodies that made close approaches.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bevilacqua |first= R. |coauthors=Menchi, O.; Milani, A.; Nobili, A.

==Bulk characteristics==
Titan is 5,150&nbsp;km across, compared to 4,879&nbsp;km for the planet Mercury, 3,474&nbsp;km for Earth's moon, and 12,742&nbsp;km for the Earth. Before the arrival of ''[[Voyager 1]]'' in 1980, Titan was thought to be slightly larger than Ganymede (diameter 5,262&nbsp;km) and thus the largest moon in the Solar System; this was an overestimation caused by Titan's dense, opaque atmosphere, which extends many miles above its surface and increases its apparent diameter.<ref name = nineplanets/> Titan's diameter and mass (and thus its density) are similar to those of the Jovian moons Ganymede and [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]].<ref name=LunineAstro>{{cite web |author=Lunine, J. |url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1493.html |title=Comparing the Triad of Great Moons |publisher=Astrobiology Magazine |date=March 21, 2005 |accessdate=2006-07-20}}</ref> Based on its bulk density of 1.88&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup>, Titan's bulk composition is half water ice and half rocky material.

[[File:Titan-Complex 'Anti-greenhouse'.jpg|thumb|True-color image of layers of haze in Titan's atmosphere]]

Titan is the only known moon with a fully developed [[atmosphere]] that consists of more than just [[trace gas]]es. Observations from the [[Voyager program|''Voyager'']] space probes have shown that the Titanian atmosphere is denser than Earth's, with a surface pressure about 1.45 times that of Earth's. Titan's atmosphere is about 1.19 times as massive as Earth's overall,<ref>Coustenis, p. 130</ref> or about 7.3 times more massive on a per surface area basis. It supports opaque haze layers that block most visible light from the Sun and other sources and renders Titan's surface features obscure. The atmosphere is so thick and the gravity so low that humans could fly through it by flapping "wings" attached to their arms.<ref name=Zubrin>{{cite book |author=Zubrin, Robert|title=Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization |location=Section: Titan |pages=163–166 |publisher=Tarcher/Putnam |year=1999 |isbn=1-58542-036-0}}</ref> Titan's lower gravity means that its atmosphere is far more extended than Earth's; even at a distance of 975&nbsp;km, the ''Cassini'' spacecraft had to make adjustments to maintain a stable orbit against atmospheric drag.<ref>{{cite web|title=Exploring the Surface of Titan with Cassini–Huygens|author=Turtle, Elizabeth P.|year=2007|publisher=Smithsonian|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfCTmv-9GkE|accessdate=2009-04-18}}</ref> The atmosphere of Titan is opaque at many [[wavelengths]] and a complete reflectance spectrum of the surface is impossible to acquire from the outside.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Schröder, S.

The presence of a significant atmosphere was first suspected by Spanish astronomer [[Josep Comas Solà]], who observed distinct [[limb darkening]] on Titan in 1903,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Atlas of the Solar System|author=Moore, P. ''et al.''|year=1990|publisher=Mitchell Beazley |isbn=0-517-00192-6}}</ref> and confirmed by [[Gerard P.

The high surface pressure meant that methane could only form a small fraction of Titan's atmosphere.<ref>Coustenis, pp. 13–15</ref> In 1981, ''Voyager 1'' made the first detailed observations of Titan's atmosphere, revealing that its surface pressure was higher than Earth's, at 1.5 bars.<ref>Coustenis, p. 22</ref>

Titan's atmosphere is the only dense, nitrogen-rich atmosphere in the Solar System aside from the Earth's.

Energy from the Sun should have converted all traces of methane in Titan's atmosphere into more complex hydrocarbons within 50 million years—a short time compared to the age of the Solar System. This suggests that methane must be somehow replenished by a reservoir on or within Titan itself. That Titan's atmosphere contains over a thousand times more methane than carbon monoxide would appear to rule out significant contributions from cometary impacts, since comets are composed of more carbon monoxide than methane. That Titan might have accreted an atmosphere from the early Saturnian nebula at the time of formation also seems unlikely; in such a case, it ought to have atmospheric abundances similar to the solar nebula, including [[hydrogen]] and [[neon]].<ref>{{cite journal| title= Formation and evolution of Titan’s atmosphere |author= Coustenis, A. |journal= Space Science Reviews |volume= 116| issue= 1-2 |pages= 171–184 |year= 2005 |doi= 10.1007/s11214-005-1954-2|bibcode = 2005SSRv..116..171C }}</ref> Many astronomers have suggested that the ultimate origin for the methane in Titan's atmosphere is from within Titan itself, released via eruptions from [[cryovolcanoes]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Titan's methane cycle |author=Sushil K.

Titan's ionosphere is also more complex than Earth's, with the main ionosphere at an altitude of 1,200&nbsp;km but with an additional layer of charged particles at 63&nbsp;km. This splits Titan's atmosphere to some extent into two separate radio-resonating chambers. The source of natural ELF waves ([[#Bulk characteristics|see above]]) on Titan is unclear as there does not appear to be extensive lightning activity.<ref name="Titan ELF" />

==Climate==
[[File:Titan atmosphere detail.svg|thumb|A graph detailing temperature, pressure, and other aspects of Titan's climate. The atmospheric haze lowers the temperature in the lower atmosphere, while methane raises the temperature at the surface. Cryovolcanoes erupt methane into the atmosphere, which then rains down onto the surface, forming lakes.]]

Titan's surface temperature is about 94&nbsp;K (−179&nbsp;°C, or −290&nbsp;°F). At this temperature water ice does not [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimate]] or [[Evaporation|evaporate]], so the atmosphere is nearly free of water vapor. The [[haze]] in Titan's atmosphere contributes to the moon's [[anti-greenhouse effect]] by reflecting sunlight back into space, making its surface significantly colder than its upper atmosphere.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.11538492|author=C.P.

Simulations of global wind patterns based on wind speed data taken by ''Huygens'' during its descent have suggested that Titan's atmosphere circulates in a single enormous [[Hadley cell]]. Warm air rises in Titan's southern hemisphere—which was experiencing summer during ''Huygens''' descent—and sinks in the northern hemisphere, resulting in high-altitude air flow from south to north and low-altitude airflow from north to south. Such a large Hadley cell is only possible on a slowly rotating world such as Titan.<ref name="Titan wind"/> The pole-to-pole wind circulation cell appears to be centered on the stratosphere; simulations suggest it ought to change every twelve years, with a three-year transition period, over the course of Titan's year (30 terrestrial years).<ref name=Rannou2006>{{cite journal |last=Rannou |first=R.; ''et al.'' |year=2006 |month=January |title= The Latitudinal Distribution of Clouds on Titan|journal= [[Science Magazine|Science]] |volume=311 |issue=5758 |pages=201–205 |url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5758/201 |accessdate=2007-09-01 |doi=10.1126/science.1118424 |pmid= 16410519 |last2=Montmessin |first2=F |last3=Hourdin |first3=F |last4=Lebonnois |first4=S|bibcode = 2006Sci...311..201R }}</ref> This cell creates a global band of low pressure—what is in effect a variation of Earth's [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ). Unlike on Earth, however, where the oceans confine the ITCZ to the tropics, on Titan, the zone wanders from one pole to the other, taking methane rainclouds with it. This means that Titan, despite its frigid temperatures, can be said to have a tropical climate.<ref name=pierrehumbert>{{cite web|title=Tropical Titan|work=astrobio.net|year=2007|url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article2485.html|accessdate=2007-10-16}}</ref>

The number of methane lakes visible near Titan's southern pole is decidedly smaller than the number observed near the north pole. As the south pole is currently in summer and the north in winter, an emerging hypothesis is that methane rains onto the poles in winter and evaporates in summer.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA Cassini File: Radar Images Titan's South Pole|work=JPL|year=2008|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=26627|accessdate=2008-01-11}}</ref>

===Clouds===

[[File:Titancloud.jpg|thumb|A cloud imaged in false color over Titan's north pole]]
In September 2006, ''Cassini'' imaged a large cloud at a height of 40&nbsp;km over Titan's north pole. Although methane is known to condense in Titan's atmosphere, the cloud was more likely to be ethane, as the detected size of the particles was only 1–3 [[micrometre|micrometers]] and ethane can also freeze at these altitudes. In December, ''Cassini'' again observed cloud cover and detected methane, ethane and other organics. The cloud was over 2400&nbsp;km in diameter and was still visible during a following flyby a month later. One hypothesis is that it is currently raining (or, if cool enough, snowing) on the north pole; the downdrafts at high northern latitudes are strong enough to drive organic particles towards the surface. These were the strongest evidence yet for the long-hypothesized "methanological" cycle (analogous to Earth's [[hydrological cycle]]) on Titan.<ref name=nasagov />

Clouds have also been found over the south pole. While typically covering 1% of Titan's disk, outburst events have been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands to as much as 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened [[insolation|levels of sunlight]] during the Titanian summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in [[convection]]. This explanation is complicated by the fact that cloud formation has been observed not only post–summer solstice but also at mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Emily L. |first=Schaller |coauthors=Brouwn, Michael E.; Roe, Henry G.

Research models that match well with observations suggest that clouds on Titan cluster at preferred coordinates and that cloud cover varies by distance from the surface on different parts of the satellite. In the polar regions (above 60 degrees [[latitude]]), widespread and permanent ethane clouds appear in and above the troposphere; at lower latitudes, mainly methane clouds are found between 15 and 18&nbsp;km, and are more sporadic and localized. In the summer hemisphere, frequent, thick but sporadic methane clouds seem to cluster around 40°.<ref name=Rannou2006/>

Ground-based observations also reveal seasonal variations in cloud cover. Over the course of Saturn's 30-year orbit, Titan's cloud systems appear to manifest for 25 years, and then fade for four to five years before reappearing again.<ref name=nasagov>{{cite web|title=Cassini Images Mammoth Cloud Engulfing Titan's North Pole|work=NASA|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cassini/media/cassini-20070201.html|year=2007|accessdate=2007-04-14}}</ref>

Cassini has also detected high-altitude, white, [[cirrus cloud|cirrus]]-type clouds in Titan's upper atmosphere, likely formed of methane.<ref>{{cite web|title=Earth-like Cirrus Clouds Found on Titan|author=Nancy Atkinson|publisher=Universe Today|url=http://www.universetoday.com/83095/earth-like-cirrus-clouds-found-on-titan/|accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref> 

Although no evidence of lightning activity has yet been observed on Titan, computer models suggest that clouds in the moon's lower troposphere can accumulate enough charge to generate lightning from an altitude of roughly 20&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|title=Titan's Thunder Could Point to Alien Lightning|author=Denise Chow|publisher=space.com|url=http://www.space.com/8381-titan-thunder-point-alien-lightning.html|accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>

==Surface features==

Radar altimetry suggests height variation is low, typically no more than 150&nbsp;meters.

Titan's surface is marked by broad regions of bright and dark terrain. These include Xanadu, a large, [[Reflection (physics)|reflective]] equatorial area about the size of [[Australia]]. It was first identified in [[infrared]] images from the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] in 1994, and later viewed by the ''Cassini'' spacecraft. The convoluted region is filled with hills and cut by valleys and chasms.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/07/060721202957.htm|title= Cassini Reveals Titan's Xanadu Region To Be An Earth-Like Land|accessdate=2007-08-27 |date=July 23, 2006 |publisher=Science Daily}}</ref> It is criss-crossed in places by dark lineaments—sinuous topographical features resembling ridges or crevices. These may represent [[tectonic]] activity, which would indicate that Xanadu is geologically young.

===Liquids===
{{Main|Lakes of Titan}}
[[File:PIA10008 Seas and Lakes on Titan.jpg|thumb|False-color ''Cassini'' radar mosaic of Titan's north polar region.

[[Ligeia Mare]] is at lower right.]]

The possibility of hydrocarbon seas on Titan was first suggested based on ''Voyager 1'' and ''2'' data that showed Titan to have a thick atmosphere of approximately the correct temperature and composition to support them, but direct evidence wasn't obtained until 1995 when data from Hubble and other observations suggested the existence of liquid methane on Titan, either in disconnected pockets or on the scale of satellite-wide oceans, similar to water on Earth.<ref>{{cite journal| author= Dermott, S.

The ''Cassini'' mission confirmed the former hypothesis, although not immediately.

===Impact craters===

Radar, SAR and imaging data from ''Cassini'' have revealed few impact craters on Titan's surface, suggesting it is relatively young. The few impact craters discovered include a 440&nbsp;km wide multi-ring impact basin named Menrva seen by ''Cassini's'' ISS as a bright-dark concentric pattern.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07365| title=PIA07365: Circus Maximus| publisher=NASA Planetary Photojournal| accessdate=2006-05-04}}</ref> A smaller, 60&nbsp;km wide, flat-floored crater named Sinlap<ref>{{cite web| url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07368| title=PIA07368: Impact Crater with Ejecta Blanket| publisher=NASA Planetary Photojournal| accessdate=2006-05-04}}</ref> and a 30&nbsp;km crater with a central peak and dark floor named ''Ksa'' have also been observed.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08737| title=PIA08737: Crater Studies on Titan| publisher=NASA Planetary Photojournal| accessdate=2006-09-15}}</ref> Radar and ''Cassini'' imaging have also revealed a number of "crateriforms", circular features on the surface of Titan that may be impact related, but lack certain features that would make identification certain. For example, a 90&nbsp;km wide ring of bright, rough material known as [[Guabonito (Titan)|Guabonito]] has been observed by ''Cassini''.<ref name=Guabonito>{{cite web| url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08425| title=PIA08425: Radar Images the Margin of Xanadu| publisher=NASA Planetary Photojournal| accessdate=2006-09-26}}</ref> This feature is thought to be an impact crater filled in by dark, windblown sediment. Several other similar features have been observed in the dark Shangri-la and Aaru regions.

Pre-''Cassini'' models of impact trajectories and angles suggest that where the impactor strikes the water ice crust, a small amount of ejecta remains as liquid water within the crater. It may persist as liquid for centuries or longer, sufficient for "the synthesis of simple precursor molecules to the origin of life."<ref>{{cite journal |last= Artemieva |first=Natalia |coauthors=Lunine, Jonathan |year=2003 |title=Cratering on Titan: impact melt, ejecta, and the fate of surface organics |journal=Icarus |volume=164 |issue= 2 |pages=471–480 |doi=10.1016/S0019-1035(03)00148-9 |bibcode=2003Icar..164..471A}}</ref> While infill from various geological processes is one reason for Titan's relative deficiency of craters, atmospheric shielding also plays a role; it is estimated that Titan's atmosphere reduces the number of craters on its surface by a factor of two.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Ivanov |first=B.

Scientists have long speculated that conditions on Titan resemble those of early Earth, though at a much lower temperature. The detection of Argon 40 in the atmosphere in 2004 indicated that volcanoes had spawned plumes of "lava" composed of water and ammonia.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Owen, Tobias |title= Planetary science: Huygens rediscovers Titan| journal=Nature| volume=438| pages=756–757 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/438756a|pmid=16363022|issue=7069|bibcode = 2005Natur.438..756O }}</ref> Global maps of the lake distribution on Titan's surface revealed that there is not enough surface methane to account for its continued presence in its atmosphere, and thus that a significant portion must be added through volcanic processes.<ref name=rain/>

In March, 2009, structures resembling lava flows were announced in a region of Titan called Hotei Orcus, which appears to fluctuate in brightness over several months. Though many phenomena were suggested to explain this fluctuation, the lava flows were found to rise 200 meters above Titan's surface, consistent with it having been erupted from beneath the surface.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Giant 'ice flows' bolster case for Titan's volcanoes|author=Shiga, David |journal=NewScientist|date=28 March 2009}}</ref>

A mountain range measuring 150&nbsp;km long, 30&nbsp;km wide and 1.5&nbsp;km high was also discovered by ''Cassini'' in 2006. This range lies in the southern hemisphere and is thought to be composed of icy material and covered in methane snow. The movement of tectonic plates, perhaps influenced by a nearby impact basin, could have opened a gap through which the mountain's material upwelled.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6174501.stm|title=Mountain range spotted on Titan |publisher=BBC News|date=December 12, 2006 |accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref> Prior to Cassini, scientists assumed that most of the topography on Titan would be impact structures, yet these findings reveal that similar to Earth, the mountains were formed through geological processes.<ref>[http://newswise.com/articles/view/536441/ Mountains Discovered on Saturn’s Largest Moon] Newswise, Retrieved on July 2, 2008.</ref> In December 2010, the ''Cassini'' mission team announced the most compelling possible cryovolcano yet found. Named [[Sotra Facula]], it is one in a chain of at least three mountains, each between 1000 and 1500&nbsp;m in height, several of which are topped by large craters. The ground around their bases appears to be overlaid by frozen lava flows.<ref>{{cite web|title=Saturn Moon Has Ice Volcano—And Maybe Life?|author=Richard A.

If volcanism on Titan really exists, it, like that on Earth, is believed to be driven by energy released from the decay of radioactive elements within the mantle.<ref name=longstaff/> Magma on Earth is made of liquid rock, which is less dense than the solid rocky crust through which it erupts. Because ice is less dense than water, Titan's watery magma would be denser than its solid icy crust. This means that cryovolcanism on Titan would require a large amount of additional energy to operate, possibly via [[tidal flexing]] from nearby Saturn.<ref name=longstaff/> Alternatively, the pressure necessary to drive the cryovolcanoes may be caused by ice I<sub>h</sub> "underplating" Titan's outer shell. The low-pressure ice, overlaying a liquid layer of [[ammonium sulfate]], ascends buoyantly, and the unstable system can produce dramatic plume events. Titan is resurfaced through the process by grain-sized ice and ammonium sulfate ash, which helps produce a [[Eolian processes|wind-shaped]] landscape and sand dune features.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fortes |first=A.

In 2008 Jeffrey Moore proposed an alternate view of Titan's geology. Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far, he asserted that Titan is a geologically dead world, whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering, [[fluvial]] and [[Eolian processes|eolian]] erosion, [[mass wasting]] and other [[exogenic]] processes. According to this hypothesis, methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold and stiff interior. Ganesa Macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center. The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded [[Escarpment|scarps]] of large multi-ring impact structures or as a result of the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior. Even in this case Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic water–ammonia mixture with the temperature of {{convert|176|K|C}}, which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto. Indeed, were it not for its lack of an atmosphere, Callisto could serve as a model for Titan's geology in this scenario. Jeffrey Moore even called Titan ''Callisto with weather''.<ref name=Moore2008/><ref name=Lakdawalla2008>{{cite web|last=Lakdawalla|first=Emily.|title=AGU: Titan: Volcanically active world, or "Callisto with weather?|url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001775/|accessdate=2010-10-11|publisher=The Planetary Society|date=December 17, 2008}}</ref>

===Dark terrain===
[[File:Titan dunes.jpg|thumb|Sand dunes on Earth (top), compared with dunes on Titan's surface]]

In the first images of Titan's surface taken by Earth-based telescopes in the early 2000s, large regions of dark terrain were revealed straddling Titan's equator.<ref name=Roe>{{cite journal|author=Roe, H.

This wind pattern causes sand dunes to build up in long parallel lines aligned west-to-east. The dunes break up around mountains, where the wind direction shifts.

The sand on Titan might have formed when liquid methane rained and eroded the ice bedrock, possibly in the form of flash floods. Alternatively, the sand could also have come from organic solids produced by photochemical reactions in Titan's atmosphere.<ref name=Saharan>{{cite news| title=Saharan Sand Dunes Found on Saturn's Moon Titan| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060504_sands_titan.html|first= Sara| last=Goudarzi| publisher=[[SPACE.com]]|date=May 4, 2006 |accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref><ref name=Lorenz2006>{{cite journal|title=The sand seas of Titan: Cassini RADAR observations of longitudinal dunes |last=Lorenz|first= RD|coauthors=''et al.'' |journal= Science|year=2006|volume= 312|pages= 724–727 |doi=10.1126/science.1123257|pmid=16675695|issue=5774|bibcode = 2006Sci...312..724L }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Linear Dunes on Titan|author= Lancaster, N. |journal= Science|year=2006|volume= 312|pages= 702–703|doi=10.1126/science.1126292|pmid=16675686|issue=5774}}</ref> Studies of dunes' composition in May 2008 revealed that they possessed less water than the rest of Titan, and are most likely to derive from organic material clumping together after raining onto the surface.<ref>{{cite web|title=Titan's Smoggy Sand Grains|work=JPL|year=2008|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features.cfm?feature=1679|accessdate=2008-05-06}}</ref>

==Observation and exploration==

Titan is never visible to the naked eye, but can be observed through small telescopes or strong binoculars. Amateur observation is difficult because of the proximity of the satellite to Saturn's brilliant globe and ring system; an occulting bar, covering part of the eyepiece and used to block the bright planet, greatly improves viewing.<ref>{{cite book |last=Benton |first=Julius L.

Observations of Titan prior to the space age were limited. In 1907 Spanish astronomer [[Josep Comas Solá]] suggested that he had observed darkening near the edges of Titan's disk and two round, white patches in its center. The deduction of an atmosphere by Kuiper in the 1940s was the next major observational event.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jyri|last=Näränen|url=http://www.astro.helsinki.fi/~naranen/titan/titan.html |title=The Atmosphere of Titan |accessdate=2007-08-19 |publisher=[[University of Helsinki]], Department of Astronomy}}</ref>

Titan was examined by both ''Voyager 1'' and ''[[Voyager 2|2]]'' in 1980 and 1981, respectively. ''Voyager 1''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s course was diverted specifically to make a closer pass of Titan. Unfortunately, the craft did not possess any instruments that could penetrate Titan's haze, an unforeseen factor.

''Voyager 2'' took only a cursory look at Titan. The ''Voyager 2'' team had the option of steering the spacecraft to take a detailed look at Titan or to use another trajectory which would allow it to visit Uranus and Neptune. Given the lack of surface features seen by ''Voyager 1'', the latter plan was implemented.

Even with the data provided by the ''Voyagers'', Titan remained a body of mystery—a planet-like satellite shrouded in an atmosphere that makes detailed observation difficult. The intrigue that had surrounded Titan since the 17th-century observations of Christiaan Huygens and Giovanni Cassini was gratified by a spacecraft named in their honor.

The ''Cassini–Huygens'' spacecraft reached Saturn on July 1, 2004, and has begun the process of mapping Titan's surface by [[radar]]. A joint project of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and [[NASA]], ''Cassini–Huygens'' has proved a very successful mission. The ''Cassini'' probe flew by Titan on October 26, 2004, and took the highest-resolution images ever of the moon's surface, at only 1,200&nbsp;km, discerning patches of light and dark that would be invisible to the human eye from the Earth.

On January 14, 2005, the ''Huygens'' probe landed on the surface of Titan, just off the easternmost tip of a bright region now called [[Adiri (Titan)|Adiri]]. The probe photographed pale hills with dark "rivers" running down to a dark plain. Current understanding is that the hills (also referred to as highlands) are composed mainly of water ice. Dark organic compounds, created in the upper atmosphere by the ultraviolet radiation of the Sun, may rain from Titan's atmosphere. They are washed down the hills with the methane rain and are deposited on the plains over geological time scales.<ref name="Seeing_Touching_Titan-ESA">{{cite news| url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Cassini-Huygens/SEMHB881Y3E_0.html| title=Seeing, touching and smelling the extraordinarily Earth-like world of Titan| publisher=ESA News, European Space Agency| date=January 21, 2005| accessdate=2005-03-28}}</ref>

After landing, ''Huygens'' photographed a dark plain covered in small rocks and pebbles, which are composed of water ice.<ref name="Seeing_Touching_Titan-ESA"/> The two rocks just below the middle of the image on the right are smaller than they may appear: the left-hand one is 15&nbsp;centimeters across, and the one in the center is 4&nbsp;centimeters across, at a distance of about 85&nbsp;centimeters from ''Huygens''. There is evidence of erosion at the base of the rocks, indicating possible fluvial activity. The surface is darker than originally expected, consisting of a mixture of water and hydrocarbon ice. It is believed that the "soil" visible in the images is precipitation from the hydrocarbon haze above.

In March 2007, NASA, ESA, and [[COSPAR]] decided to name the ''Huygens'' landing site the ''[[Hubert Curien]] Memorial Station'' in memory of the former president of the ESA.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/esaCP/SEM9GNN0LYE_index_0.html |title=Huygens landing site to be named after Hubert Curien |publisher=ESA |date=March 5, 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-06}}</ref>

While the ''Cassini–Huygens'' mission was not equipped to provide evidence for biology or complex organics, it showed an environment on Titan that is similar, in some ways, to ones theorized for the primordial Earth.<ref name=Raulin2005/> Scientists believe that the atmosphere of early Earth was similar in composition to the current atmosphere on Titan, with the important exception of a lack of water vapor on Titan.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff|date=October 4, 2010|title=Lakes on Saturn's Moon Titan Filled With Liquid Hydrocarbons Like Ethane and Methane, Not Water|work=ScienceDaily|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/09/100921144133.htm|accessdate=2010-10-05}}</ref> Many hypotheses have developed that attempt to bridge the step from chemical to biological evolution.

===Formation of complex molecules===

The [[Miller-Urey experiment]] and several following experiments have shown that with an atmosphere similar to that of Titan and the addition of [[UV radiation]], complex molecules and polymer substances like tholins can be generated. The reaction starts with [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] of nitrogen and methane, forming hydrogen cyanide and acetylene. Further reactions have been studied extensively.<ref name=Raulin2002>{{cite journal|journal = Space Science Review|volume= 104|issue = 1–2|pages = 377–394|year= 2002|doi = 10.1023/A:1023636623006|title = Organic chemistry and exobiology on Titan|author = Raulin F., Owen T.|bibcode = 2002SSRv..104..377R }}</ref>

In October 2010, Sarah Horst of the [[University of Arizona]] reported finding the five [[nucleotide bases]]—building blocks of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]—among the many compounds produced when energy was applied to a combination of gases like those in Titan's atmosphere. Horst also found [[amino acids]], the building blocks of [[protein]]. She said it was the first time nucleotide bases and amino acids had been found in such an experiment without liquid water being present.<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff|date=October 8, 2010|title=Titan's haze may hold ingredients for life|work=Astronomy|url=http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&id=10302|accessdate=2010-10-14}}</ref>

===Possible subsurface habitats===

Laboratory simulations have led to the suggestion that enough organic material exists on Titan to start a chemical evolution analogous to what is thought to have started life on Earth. While the analogy assumes the presence of liquid water for longer periods than is currently observable, several theories suggest that liquid water from an impact could be preserved under a frozen isolation layer.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Artemivia N., Lunine J,|title = Cratering on Titan: impact melt, ejecta, and the fate of surface organics|year = 2003|journal = Icarus|volume = 164|issue = 2| pages = 471–480|doi=10.1016/S0019-1035(03)00148-9|bibcode=2003Icar..164..471A}}</ref> It has also been observed that liquid ammonia oceans could exist deep below the surface;<ref name=Grasset2000/><ref>Richard A. Lovett [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080320-titan-ocean_2.html Saturn Moon Titan May Have Underground Ocean], National Geographic, March 20, 2008</ref> one model suggests an ammonia–water solution as much as 200&nbsp;km deep beneath a water ice crust, conditions that, "while extreme by terrestrial standards, are such that life could indeed survive".<ref name=Fortes2000/> [[Heat transfer]] between the interior and upper layers would be critical in sustaining any sub-surface oceanic life.<ref name=Grasset2000/> Detection of microbial life on Titan would depend on its biogenic effects. That the atmospheric methane and nitrogen might be of biological origin has been examined, for example.<ref name=Fortes2000/>

===Methane and life at the surface===
{{see also|Hypothetical types of biochemistry}}
It has also been suggested that life could exist in the lakes of liquid methane on Titan, just as organisms on Earth live in water.<ref name=mckay/> Such creatures would inhale H<sub>2</sub> in place of O<sub>2</sub>, react it with [[acetylene]] instead of [[glucose]], and exhale methane instead of carbon dioxide.<ref name=mckay/> In 2005, [[astrobiologist]] [[Christopher McKay (planetary scientist)|Chris McKay]] predicted that if methanogenic life is consuming atmospheric hydrogen in sufficient volume, it will have a measurable effect on the mixing ratio in the troposphere.<ref name=mckay>{{cite journal|journal = Icarus|volume= 178|issue = 1|pages = 274–276|year= 2005|doi = 10.1016/j.icarus.2005.05.018|title = Possibilities for methanogenic life in liquid methane on the surface of Titan|author = McKay, C. P.; Smith, H. D.|bibcode=2005Icar..178..274M}}</ref> 

Evidence for this form of life was identified in 2010 by Darrell Strobel of [[Johns Hopkins University]]; an over-abundance of [[molecular hydrogen]] in the upper atmospheric layers, which leads to a downward flow at a rate of roughly 10<sup>25</sup> molecules per second. Near the surface the hydrogen apparently disappears, which may imply its consumption by [[methanogenic]] life forms.<ref name=mckay/><ref name=methlife>{{cite web|title= What is Consuming Hydrogen and Acetylene on Titan?|publisher=NASA/JPL|year=2010 |accessdate=2010-06-06|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-190}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Molecular hydrogen in Titan’s atmosphere: Implications of the measured tropospheric and thermospheric mole fractions|author=Strobel, Darrell F.|journal=Icarus|volume=208|issue=2|pages=878–886|year=2010|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2010.03.003|url=http://astrobiology.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Icarus-2010-Strobel.pdf|bibcode=2010Icar..208..878S}}</ref> Another paper released the same month showed little evidence of acetylene on Titan's surface, where scientists had expected the compound to accumulate; according to Strobel, this is consistent with the hypothesis that acetylene is being consumed by methanogens.<ref name=methlife/> Chris McKay, while agreeing that presence of life is a possible explanation for the findings about hydrogen and acetylene, has cautioned that other explanations are currently more likely: namely the possibility that the results are due to human error, or to the presence of some as-yet unknown [[catalyst]] in the soil.<ref name=life?>{{cite web|title= Have We Discovered Evidence For Life On Titan|author=Mckay, Chris|year=2010|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Have_We_Discovered_Evidence_For_Life_On_Titan_999.html|publisher=SpaceDaily|accessdate=2010-06-10}}</ref> He noted that such a catalyst, effective at 95 K, would in itself be a startling discovery.<ref name="life?"/> <!-- its existence, or its existence & presence? ie. is such a catalyst already known? -->

===Obstacles===
Despite these biological possibilities, there are formidable obstacles to life on Titan, and any analogy to Earth is inexact. At a vast distance from the [[Sun]], Titan is frigid (a fact exacerbated by the anti-greenhouse effect of its cloud cover), and its atmosphere lacks CO<sub>2</sub>. Because of these difficulties, scientists such as [[Jonathan Lunine]] have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life, than as an experiment for examining theories on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1130.html| title=Saturn's Moon Titan: Prebiotic Laboratory|publisher=Astrobiology Magazine |date=August 11, 2004|accessdate=2004-08-11}}</ref> While life itself may not exist, the prebiotic conditions of the Titanian environment and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding the early history of the terrestrial biosphere.<ref name=Raulin2005>{{cite journal|journal = Space Science Review|volume= 116|issue = 1–2|pages = 471–487|year= 2005|doi = 10.1007/s11214-005-1967-x|title = Exo-astrobiological aspects of Europa and Titan: From observations to speculations|author = Raulin, F.|bibcode = 2005SSRv..116..471R }}</ref> Using Titan as a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft, but laboratory experiment, and chemical and photochemical modeling on Earth.<ref name=Raulin2002/>

===Panspermia hypothesis===

An alternate explanation for life's hypothetical existence on Titan has been proposed: if life were to be found on Titan, it would be statistically more likely to have originated from Earth than to have appeared independently, a process known as [[panspermia]]. It is theorized that large asteroid and cometary impacts on Earth's surface have caused hundreds of millions of fragments of microbe-laden rock to escape Earth's gravity. Calculations indicate that a number of these would encounter many of the bodies in the Solar System, including Titan.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4819370.stm |title=Earth could seed Titan with life |publisher=BBC News |date=March 18, 2006 |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author = Gladman, Brett; Dones, Luke; Levinson, Harold F.; Burns, Joseph A.|title = Impact Seeding and Reseeding in the Inner Solar System|year = 2005|journal = Astrobiology|volume = 5|pages = 483–496 |doi=10.1089/ast.2005.5.483|pmid = 16078867|issue = 4|bibcode=2005AsBio...5..483G}}</ref> On the other hand, Jonathan Lunine has argued that any living things in Titan's cryogenic hydrocarbon lakes would need to be so different chemically from Earth life that it would not be possible for one to be the ancestor of the other.<ref>[http://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.0762 Jonathan Lunine "Saturn’s Titan: A Strict Test for Life’s Cosmic Ubiquity"] (accepted for publication in ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'') page 13</ref>

===Future conditions===
Conditions on Titan could become far more habitable in the future. Six billion years from now, as the Sun becomes a [[red giant]], surface temperatures could rise to ~{{convert|200|K|°C|-1|abbr=on}}, high enough for stable oceans of water/ammonia mixture to exist on the surface. As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect on the surface and enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create an environment agreeable to exotic forms of life, and will persist for several hundred million years. This was sufficient time for simple life to evolve on Earth, although the presence of ammonia on Titan will cause the same chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.<ref>{{cite web|title=Titan under a red giant sun: A new kind of "habitable" moon|author=Lorenz, Ralph D.; Lunine, Jonathan I. and McKay, Christopher P. |work=NASA Ames Research Center, Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, Department of Planetary Sciences, University of Arizona|year=1997|url=http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~rlorenz/redgiant.pdf|accessdate=2008-03-21}}</ref>
