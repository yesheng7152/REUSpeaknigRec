Titan is the sixth [[hydrostatic equilibrium|ellipsoidal]] moon from Saturn. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan has a diameter roughly 50% larger than [[Moon|Earth's moon]] and is 80% more [[mass]]ive. It is the [[List of natural satellites by diameter|second-largest moon]] in the [[Solar System]], after [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], and it is larger by volume than the smallest planet, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], although only half as massive. Titan was the first known moon of Saturn, discovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer [[Christiaan Huygens]], and was the fifth moon of a planet other than the earth to be discovered.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>

The moon itself is primarily composed of water ice and rocky material. Much as with [[Venus]] prior to the [[Space Age]], the dense, opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan's surface until new information accumulated with the arrival of the ''[[Cassini–Huygens]]'' mission in 2004, including the discovery of liquid [[hydrocarbon]] lakes in the satellite's polar regions. These are the only large, stable bodies of surface liquid known to exist anywhere other than [[Earth]]. The surface is geologically young; although mountains and several possible [[cryovolcano]]es have been discovered, it is smooth and few [[impact crater]]s have been discovered.

The atmosphere of Titan is largely composed of nitrogen; minor components lead to the formation of methane and [[ethane]] clouds and nitrogen-rich organic smog. The climate—including wind and rain—creates surface features similar to those of Earth, such as sand dunes, rivers, lakes and seas (probably of liquid methane or ethane) and shorelines, and, like on Earth, is dominated by seasonal weather patterns. With its liquids (both surface and subsurface) and robust nitrogen atmosphere, Titan is viewed as analogous to the early Earth, although at a much lower temperature. The satellite has thus been cited as a possible host for [[Microorganism|microbial]] [[extraterrestrial life]] or, at least, as a prebiotic environment rich in complex organic chemistry. Researchers have suggested a possible underground liquid ocean might serve as a biotic environment.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Grasset2000</attr><inner>

Titan was discovered on March 25, 1655, by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] astronomer Christiaan Huygens. Huygens was inspired by [[Galileo]]'s discovery of Jupiter's four [[Galilean moons|largest moons]] in 1610 and his improvements on [[telescope]] technology.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>

He named it simply ''Saturni Luna'' (or ''Luna Saturni'', Latin for &quot;Saturn's moon&quot;), publishing in the 1655 tract ''De Saturni Luna Observatio Nova''. After [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] published his discoveries of four more moons of Saturn between 1673 and 1686, astronomers fell into the habit of referring to these and Titan as Saturn I through V (with Titan then in fourth position).

Titan orbits Saturn once every 15 days and 22 hours. Like the Earth's moon and many of the other gas giant satellites, its orbital period is identical to its rotational period; Titan is thus [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] in [[synchronous rotation]] with Saturn, and thus always shows one face to the planet. Because of this, there is a sub-Saturnian point on its surface, from which the planet would appear to hang directly overhead. Longitudes on Titan are measured westward from the meridian passing through this point.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.evs-islands.com/2008/02/titans-unnamed-methane-sea.html|title=EVS-Islands: Titan's Unnamed Methane Sea|accessdate=22 October 2009}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Its orbital eccentricity is 0.0288, and it is inclined 0.348 degrees relative to the Saturnian equator.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=horizons</attr><inner>Unless otherwise specified: {{cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/horizons.cgi#top |title=JPL HORIZONS solar system data and ephemeris computation service |work=Solar System Dynamics|publisher=NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory |accessdate=2007-08-19}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><comment>&lt;!-- As http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_elem shows, that's 0.28° to the local Laplace plane, itself inclined 0.6° to Saturn's equator; an example of the calculation required to get the number shown here is given at [[Talk:Phoebe (moon)]] --&gt;</comment> Viewed from Earth, the moon reaches an angular distance of about 20 Saturn radii (just over 1.2 million kilometers) from Saturn and subtends a disk 0.8 [[arcsecond]]s in diameter.

Titan is locked in a 3:4 [[orbital resonance]] with the small, irregularly shaped satellite [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]]. A &quot;slow and smooth&quot; evolution of the resonance—in which Hyperion would have migrated from a chaotic orbit—is considered unlikely, based on models.

Titan is the only known moon with a fully developed [[atmosphere]] that consists of more than just [[trace gas]]es. Observations from the [[Voyager program|''Voyager'']] space probes have shown that the Titanian atmosphere is denser than Earth's, with a surface pressure about 1.45 times that of Earth's.

Energy from the Sun should have converted all traces of methane in Titan's atmosphere into more complex hydrocarbons within 50 million years—a short time compared to the age of the Solar System. This suggests that methane must be somehow replenished by a reservoir on or within Titan itself. That Titan's atmosphere contains over a thousand times more methane than carbon monoxide would appear to rule out significant contributions from cometary impacts, since comets are composed of more carbon monoxide than methane. That Titan might have accreted an atmosphere from the early Saturnian nebula at the time of formation also seems unlikely; in such a case, it ought to have atmospheric abundances similar to the solar nebula, including [[hydrogen]] and [[neon]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal| title= Formation and evolution of Titan’s atmosphere |author= Coustenis, A. |journal= Space Science Reviews |volume= 116| issue= 1-2 |pages= 171–184 |year= 2005 |doi= 10.1007/s11214-005-1954-2|bibcode = 2005SSRv..116..171C }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Many astronomers have suggested that the ultimate origin for the methane in Titan's atmosphere is from within Titan itself, released via eruptions from [[cryovolcanoes]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal |title=Titan's methane cycle |author=Sushil K.

The number of methane lakes visible near Titan's southern pole is decidedly smaller than the number observed near the north pole.

[[File:Titancloud.jpg|thumb|A cloud imaged in false color over Titan's north pole]]
In September 2006, ''Cassini'' imaged a large cloud at a height of 40&amp;nbsp;km over Titan's north pole. Although methane is known to condense in Titan's atmosphere, the cloud was more likely to be ethane, as the detected size of the particles was only 1–3 [[micrometre|micrometers]] and ethane can also freeze at these altitudes. In December, ''Cassini'' again observed cloud cover and detected methane, ethane and other organics. The cloud was over 2400&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and was still visible during a following flyby a month later. One hypothesis is that it is currently raining (or, if cool enough, snowing) on the north pole; the downdrafts at high northern latitudes are strong enough to drive organic particles towards the surface. These were the strongest evidence yet for the long-hypothesized &quot;methanological&quot; cycle (analogous to Earth's [[hydrological cycle]]) on Titan.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=nasagov </attr></ext>

Clouds have also been found over the south pole. While typically covering 1% of Titan's disk, outburst events have been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands to as much as 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened [[insolation|levels of sunlight]] during the Titanian summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in [[convection]]. This explanation is complicated by the fact that cloud formation has been observed not only post–summer solstice but also at mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at the south pole possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal |last=Emily L. |first=Schaller |coauthors=Brouwn, Michael E.; Roe, Henry G.

Research models that match well with observations suggest that clouds on Titan cluster at preferred coordinates and that cloud cover varies by distance from the surface on different parts of the satellite. In the polar regions (above 60 degrees [[latitude]]), widespread and permanent ethane clouds appear in and above the troposphere; at lower latitudes, mainly methane clouds are found between 15 and 18&amp;nbsp;km, and are more sporadic and localized.

Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far, he asserted that Titan is a geologically dead world, whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering, [[fluvial]] and [[Eolian processes|eolian]] erosion, [[mass wasting]] and other [[exogenic]] processes. According to this hypothesis, methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan's cold and stiff interior. Ganesa Macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center. The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded [[Escarpment|scarps]] of large multi-ring impact structures or as a result of the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior. Even in this case Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic water–ammonia mixture with the temperature of <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>176</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>K</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>C</value></part></template>, which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core. The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto. Indeed, were it not for its lack of an atmosphere, Callisto could serve as a model for Titan's geology in this scenario. Jeffrey Moore even called Titan ''Callisto with weather''.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Moore2008</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Lakdawalla2008</attr><inner>{{cite web|last=Lakdawalla|first=Emily.|title=AGU: Titan: Volcanically active world, or &quot;Callisto with weather?|url=http://www.planetary.org/blog/article/00001775/|accessdate=2010-10-11|publisher=The Planetary Society|date=December 17, 2008}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

The sand on Titan might have formed when liquid methane rained and eroded the ice bedrock, possibly in the form of flash floods.

Even with the data provided by the ''Voyagers'', Titan remained a body of mystery—a planet-like satellite shrouded in an atmosphere that makes detailed observation difficult. The intrigue that had surrounded Titan since the 17th-century observations of Christiaan Huygens and Giovanni Cassini was gratified by a spacecraft named in their honor.

The ''Cassini–Huygens'' spacecraft reached Saturn on July 1, 2004, and has begun the process of mapping Titan's surface by [[radar]]. A joint project of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and [[NASA]], ''Cassini–Huygens'' has proved a very successful mission. The ''Cassini'' probe flew by Titan on October 26, 2004, and took the highest-resolution images ever of the moon's surface, at only 1,200&amp;nbsp;km, discerning patches of light and dark that would be invisible to the human eye from the Earth.

</comment>On January 14, 2005, the ''Huygens'' probe landed on the surface of Titan, just off the easternmost tip of a bright region now called [[Adiri (Titan)|Adiri]]. The probe photographed pale hills with dark &quot;rivers&quot; running down to a dark plain. Current understanding is that the hills (also referred to as highlands) are composed mainly of water ice. Dark organic compounds, created in the upper atmosphere by the ultraviolet radiation of the Sun, may rain from Titan's atmosphere. They are washed down the hills with the methane rain and are deposited on the plains over geological time scales.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Seeing_Touching_Titan-ESA&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite news| url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Cassini-Huygens/SEMHB881Y3E_0.html| title=Seeing, touching and smelling the extraordinarily Earth-like world of Titan| publisher=ESA News, European Space Agency| date=January 21, 2005| accessdate=2005-03-28}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

There is evidence of erosion at the base of the rocks, indicating possible fluvial activity. The surface is darker than originally expected, consisting of a mixture of water and hydrocarbon ice. It is believed that the &quot;soil&quot; visible in the images is precipitation from the hydrocarbon haze above.

Near the surface the hydrogen apparently disappears, which may imply its consumption by [[methanogenic]] life forms.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=mckay</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=methlife</attr><inner>{{cite web|title= What is Consuming Hydrogen and Acetylene on Titan?|publisher=NASA/JPL|year=2010 |accessdate=2010-06-06|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2010-190}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal|title=Molecular hydrogen in Titan’s atmosphere: Implications of the measured tropospheric and thermospheric mole fractions|author=Strobel, Darrell F.|journal=Icarus|volume=208|issue=2|pages=878–886|year=2010|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2010.03.003|url=http://astrobiology.jhu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Icarus-2010-Strobel.pdf|bibcode=2010Icar..208..878S}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Another paper released the same month showed little evidence of acetylene on Titan's surface, where scientists had expected the compound to accumulate; according to Strobel, this is consistent with the hypothesis that acetylene is being consumed by methanogens.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=methlife</attr></ext> Chris McKay, while agreeing that presence of life is a possible explanation for the findings about hydrogen and acetylene, has cautioned that other explanations are currently more likely: namely the possibility that the results are due to human error, or to the presence of some as-yet unknown [[catalyst]] in the soil.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=life?</attr><inner>{{cite web|title= Have We Discovered Evidence For Life On Titan|author=Mckay, Chris|year=2010|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Have_We_Discovered_Evidence_For_Life_On_Titan_999.html|publisher=SpaceDaily|accessdate=2010-06-10}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> He noted that such a catalyst, effective at 95 K, would in itself be a startling discovery.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;life?&quot;</attr></ext> <comment>&lt;!-- its existence, or its existence &amp; presence? ie. is such a catalyst already known? --&gt;</comment>

<h level="3" i="20">===Obstacles===</h>
Despite these biological possibilities, there are formidable obstacles to life on Titan, and any analogy to Earth is inexact. At a vast distance from the [[Sun]], Titan is frigid (a fact exacerbated by the anti-greenhouse effect of its cloud cover), and its atmosphere lacks CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Because of these difficulties, scientists such as [[Jonathan Lunine]] have viewed Titan less as a likely habitat for life, than as an experiment for examining theories on the conditions that prevailed prior to the appearance of life on Earth.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web| url=http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1130.html| title=Saturn's Moon Titan: Prebiotic Laboratory|publisher=Astrobiology Magazine |date=August 11, 2004|accessdate=2004-08-11}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> While life itself may not exist, the prebiotic conditions of the Titanian environment and the associated organic chemistry remain of great interest in understanding the early history of the terrestrial biosphere.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Raulin2005</attr><inner>{{cite journal|journal = Space Science Review|volume= 116|issue = 1–2|pages = 471–487|year= 2005|doi = 10.1007/s11214-005-1967-x|title = Exo-astrobiological aspects of Europa and Titan: From observations to speculations|author = Raulin, F.|bibcode = 2005SSRv..116..471R }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Using Titan as a prebiotic experiment involves not only observation through spacecraft, but laboratory experiment, and chemical and photochemical modeling on Earth.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Raulin2002</attr></ext>

An alternate explanation for life's hypothetical existence on Titan has been proposed: if life were to be found on Titan, it would be statistically more likely to have originated from Earth than to have appeared independently, a process known as [[panspermia]]. It is theorized that large asteroid and cometary impacts on Earth's surface have caused hundreds of millions of fragments of microbe-laden rock to escape Earth's gravity. Calculations indicate that a number of these would encounter many of the bodies in the Solar System, including Titan.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4819370.stm |title=Earth could seed Titan with life |publisher=BBC News |date=March 18, 2006 |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite journal|author = Gladman, Brett; Dones, Luke; Levinson, Harold F.; Burns, Joseph A.|title = Impact Seeding and Reseeding in the Inner Solar System|year = 2005|journal = Astrobiology|volume = 5|pages = 483–496 |doi=10.1089/ast.2005.5.483|pmid = 16078867|issue = 4|bibcode=2005AsBio...5..483G}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> On the other hand, Jonathan Lunine has argued that any living things in Titan's cryogenic hydrocarbon lakes would need to be so different chemically from Earth life that it would not be possible for one to be the ancestor of the other.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>[http://arxiv.org/pdf/0908.0762 Jonathan Lunine &quot;Saturn’s Titan: A Strict Test for Life’s Cosmic Ubiquity&quot;] (accepted for publication in ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'') page 13</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

As the Sun's ultraviolet output decreases, the haze in Titan's upper atmosphere will be depleted, lessening the anti-greenhouse effect on the surface and enabling the greenhouse created by atmospheric methane to play a far greater role. These conditions together could create an environment agreeable to exotic forms of life, and will persist for several hundred million years. This was sufficient time for simple life to evolve on Earth, although the presence of ammonia on Titan will cause the same chemical reactions to proceed more slowly.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|title=Titan under a red giant sun: A new kind of &quot;habitable&quot; moon|author=Lorenz, Ralph D.; Lunine, Jonathan I. and McKay, Christopher P. |work=NASA Ames Research Center, Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, Department of Planetary Sciences, University of Arizona|year=1997|url=http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~rlorenz/redgiant.pdf|accessdate=2008-03-21}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>
