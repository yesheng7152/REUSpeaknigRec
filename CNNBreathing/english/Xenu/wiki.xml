Xenu was about to be deposed from power, so he devised a plot to eliminate the excess population from his dominions.

The now-disembodied victims' souls, which Hubbard called ''[[thetan]]s'', were blown into the air by the blast. They were captured by Xenu's forces using an &quot;electronic ribbon&quot; (&quot;which also was a type of [[standing wave]]&quot;) and sucked into &quot;vacuum zones&quot; around the world. The hundreds of billions<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;partridge&quot; </attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>A billion in [[Long and short scales|Short Scale]] is a thousand million in Long Scale.</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> of captured thetans were taken to a type of [[movie theater|cinema]], where they were forced to watch a &quot;[[3-D film|three-D]], super colossal motion picture&quot; for thirty-six days. This implanted what Hubbard termed &quot;various misleading data&quot;' (collectively termed the R6 [[implant (Scientology)|implant]]) into the memories of the hapless thetans, &quot;which has to do with [[God]], the [[Devil]], [[Space opera in Scientology doctrine|space opera]], et cetera&quot;. This included all [[Major religious groups|world religions]], with Hubbard specifically attributing [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and the image of the [[Crucifixion]] to the influence of Xenu. The two &quot;implant stations&quot; cited by Hubbard were said to have been located on Hawaii and [[Las Palmas (province)|Las Palmas]] in the [[Canary Islands]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;corydon1987&quot;</attr><inner>{{Harvnb|Corydon|Hubbard, Jr.|1987|pp=364–367}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

In addition to implanting new beliefs in the thetans, the images deprived them of their sense of [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]]. When the thetans left the projection areas, they started to cluster together in groups of a few thousand, having lost the ability to differentiate between each other. Each cluster of thetans gathered into one of the few remaining bodies that survived the explosion. These became what are known as ''[[body thetan]]s'', which are said to be still clinging to and adversely affecting everyone except those Scientologists who have performed the necessary steps to remove them.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;lamont49&quot; </attr></ext>

A government faction known as the Loyal Officers finally overthrew Xenu and his renegades, and locked him away in &quot;an electronic mountain trap&quot; from which he still has not escaped.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;urban2006&quot; </attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;reece&quot; </attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;listener&quot; </attr></ext> Although the location of Xenu is sometimes said to be the [[Pyrenees]] on Earth, this is actually the location Hubbard gave elsewhere for an ancient &quot;Martian report station&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book | last =Rolph | first =C.

Within Scientology, the Xenu story is referred to as &quot;The Wall of Fire&quot; or &quot;Incident II&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;savino&quot; </attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;lamont49&quot;</attr><inner>{{Harvnb|Lamont|1986|pp=49–50}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Hubbard attached tremendous importance to it, saying that it constituted &quot;the secrets of a disaster which resulted in the decay of life as we know it in this sector of the galaxy&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;miller266&quot;</attr></ext> The broad outlines of the story—that 75 million years ago a great catastrophe happened in this sector of the galaxy which caused profoundly negative effects for everyone since then—are publicly admitted to lower-level Scientologists. However, the details are kept strictly confidential, at least within Scientology.

The OT III document describes how Hubbard entered the Wall of Fire but emerged alive, &quot;probably the only one ever to do so in 75,000,000 years&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;corydon1987&quot; </attr></ext> He first publicly announced his &quot;breakthrough&quot; in ''Ron's Journal 67'' (''RJ67''), a taped lecture Hubbard recorded on September 20, 1967, to be sent to all Scientologists.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;nightline&quot; </attr></ext> According to Hubbard, his research was achieved at the cost of a broken back, knee and arm.

In ''RJ67'',<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;nightline&quot; </attr></ext> Hubbard then alludes to the devastating effect of Xenu's genocide:
<template lineStart="1"><title>cquote</title><part><name index="1"/><value>And it is very true that a great catastrophe occurred on this planet and in the other 75 planets which formed this [Galactic] Confederacy 75 million years ago. It has since that time been a desert, and it has been the lot of just a handful to try to push its technology up to a level where someone might adventure forward, penetrate the catastrophe, and undo it. We're well on our way to making this occur.</value></part></template>

OT III also deals with ''Incident I'', set four [[1,000,000,000,000,000|quadrillion]]<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Four thousand billion in [[Long and short scales|Long Scale]].</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> years ago. In ''Incident I'', the unsuspecting thetan was subjected to a loud snapping noise followed by a flood of luminescence, then saw a [[chariot]] followed by a trumpeting [[cherub]]. After a loud set of snaps, the thetan was overwhelmed by darkness. This is described as the implant offering the gateway to this universe, meaning that these traumatic memories are what separate thetans from their static (natural, godlike) state.

Hubbard uses the existence of body thetans to explain many of the physical and mental ailments of humanity which, he says, prevent people from achieving their highest spiritual levels.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;lamont49&quot; </attr></ext> OT III tells the Scientologist to locate body thetans and release them from the effects of Incidents I and II by auditing them.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;lamont49&quot; </attr></ext> This is accomplished in solo auditing, where the Scientologist holds both cans of an [[E-meter]] in one hand and asks questions as an auditor.

Hubbard wrote OT III in late 1966 and early 1967 in [[North Africa]] while on his way to [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria|Las Palmas]] to join the ''Enchanter'', the first vessel of his private Scientology fleet (the &quot;[[Sea Org]]&quot;).<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;miller266&quot;</attr><inner>{{Harvnb|Miller|1988|p=266}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> (OT III says &quot;In December 1967 I knew someone had to take the plunge&quot;, but the material was publicised well before this.) He emphasized later that OT III was his own personal discovery.

Critics of Scientology have suggested that other factors may have been at work.

Elements of the Xenu story appeared in Scientology before OT III. Hubbard's descriptions of extraterrestrial conflicts were put forward as early as 1950 in his book ''Have You Lived Before This Life?'', and were enthusiastically endorsed by Scientologists who documented their [[Reincarnation|past lives]] on other planets.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;partridge&quot; </attr></ext>

Since the 1980s, the volcano has also been depicted in [[Television advertisement|television commercials]] advertising ''Dianetics''. Scientology's &quot;[[Sea Org]]&quot;, an elite group within the church that originated with Hubbard's personal staff aboard his fleet of ships, takes many of its symbols from the story of Xenu and OT III. It is explicitly intended to be a revival of the &quot;Loyal Officers&quot; who overthrew Xenu. Its logo, a wreath with 26 leaves, represents the 26 stars of Xenu's Galactic Confederacy.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Hubbard, &quot;Ron's Talk to Pubs Org World Wide&quot;, tape of April 1968</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> According to an official Scientology dictionary, &quot;the Sea Org symbol, adopted and used as the symbol of a Galactic Confederacy far back in the history of this sector, derives much of its power and authority from that association&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=Lafayette Ronald| coauthors=LRH Personal Secretary Office| title=Modern Management Technology Defined: Hubbard Dictionary of Administration and Management |year=1976 |isbn=0884040402|publisher=Church of Scientology of California|page=467}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

In the Advanced Orgs in [[Edinburgh]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], Scientology staff were at one time ordered to wear all-white uniforms with silver boots, to mimic Xenu's Galactic Patrol as depicted on the cover of ''[[Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science]]''. This was reportedly done on the basis of Hubbard's declaration in his Flag Order 652 that mankind would accept regulation from that group which had last betrayed it—hence the imitation of Xenu's henchmen. (This was almost certainly a misinterpretation of what Hubbard meant—he was most likely referring to [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]], whom he believed had played a key role in Xenu's crimes.) In Los Angeles, a nightwatch was ordered to watch for returning spaceships.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;atack190&quot;</attr><inner>{{Harvnb|Atack|1990|p=190}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Senior members of the Church of Scientology have several times publicly denied or minimized the importance of the Xenu story, but others have admitted its existence.

Versions of the Xenu story have appeared in both television shows and stage productions. The [[Off-Broadway]] [[satire|satirical]] musical ''[[A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant]]'', first staged in 2003 and winner of an [[Obie Award]] in 2004, featured children in alien costumes telling the story of Xenu.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite news|first=David|last=Rooney |work=Variety|date=December 10, 2006|title=Theatre Review: A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932286.html?categoryid=33&amp;cs=1|accessdate=2008-11-22}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext><comment>&lt;!-- commons picture at http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:2007_A_Very_Merry_Xenu.jpg--&gt;</comment>

The Xenu story was again satirized in &quot;[[Trapped in the Closet (South Park)|Trapped in the Closet]]&quot;, a November 2005 episode of the [[animated]] [[television series]] ''[[South Park]]''. The [[Emmy Award|Emmy]]-nominated episode, which lampooned Scientologist [[Tom Cruise]], depicted Xenu as a vaguely humanoid alien with tentacles for arms, in a sequence that had the words &quot;This Is What Scientologists Actually Believe&quot; superimposed on screen.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Arp2007&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book|author=Robert Arp|title=South Park and philosophy: you know, I learned something today|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xTt5l12bsVkC&amp;pg=PA137|accessdate=23 January 2011|year=2007|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-6160-2|pages=137–138}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The episode became the subject of controversy when Scientologist [[Isaac Hayes]], the voice of the character &quot;Chef&quot; in ''South Park'', quit the show in March 2006, just prior to the episode's first scheduled re-screening, citing ''South Park'''s &quot;inappropriate ridicule&quot; of religion.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Rumble</attr><inner>{{cite news|first=Erin|last=Carlson |work=Concord Monitor|date=March 21, 2006|title=Rumble in 'South Park'|url=http://www.concordmonitor.com/article/rumble-in-south-park|accessdate=2011-01-22}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Hayes' statement did not mention the episode in particular, but expressed his view that the show's habit of parodying religion was part of a &quot;growing insensitivity toward personal spiritual beliefs&quot; in the media that was also reflected in the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Muhammad cartoons controversy]]: &quot;There is a place in this world for satire, but there is a time when satire ends and intolerance and bigotry towards religious beliefs of others begins.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;StratynerKeller2009&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book|author1=Leslie Stratyner|author2=James R.

[[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]], the creators of ''South Park'', felt that Comedy Central's owners [[Viacom]] had cancelled the repeat because of the upcoming release of the Tom Cruise film ''[[Mission Impossible 3]]'' by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]], another Viacom company: &quot;I only know what we were told, that people involved with M:I:III wanted the episode off the air and that is why Comedy Central had to do it.

<h level="2" i="9">==Commentary==</h>

Writing in the book ''[[Scientology (James R. Lewis book)|Scientology]]'' published by [[Oxford University Press]], contributor [[Mikael Rothstein]] observes that, &quot;To my knowledge no real analysis of Scientology's Xenu myth has appeared in scholarly publications. The most sober and enlightening text about the Xenu myth is probably the article on Wikipedia (English version) and, even if brief, Andreas Grünschloss's piece on Scientology in Lewis (2000: 266–268).&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;rothstein&quot; </attr></ext> Rothstein places the Xenu text by L. Ron Hubbard within the context of a [[creation myth]] within the Scientology methodology, and characterizes it as &quot;one of Scientology's more important religious narratives, the text that apparently constitutes the basic (sometimes implicit) mythology of the movement, the ''Xenu myth'', which is basically a story of the origin of man on Earth and the human condition.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;rothstein&quot;</attr><inner>{{Cite book  | last=Rothstein|first=Mikael|editor-last =[[James R.

Several authors have pointed out structural similarities between the Xenu story and the mythology of [[gnosticism]]. James A. Herrick, writing about the Xenu text in ''The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition'', notes that &quot;Hubbard's gnostic leanings are evident in his account of human origins [...] In Hubbard, ideas first expressed in science fiction are seamlessly transformed into a worldwide religion with affinities to gnosticism.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Herrick2004&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book|author=James A.

Authors Michael McDowell and Nathan Robert Brown discuss misconceptions about the Xenu text in their book ''World Religions at Your Fingertips'', and observe, &quot;Probably the most controversial, misunderstood, and frequently misrepresented part of the Scientology religion has to do with a Scientology myth commonly referred to as the Legend of Xenu. While this story has now been undoubtedly proven a part of the religion (despite the fact that church representatives often deny its existence), the story's true role in Scientology is often misrepresented by its critics as proof that they 'believe in alien parasites.' While the story may indeed seem odd, this is simply not the case.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;michaelmcdowell&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book| last =McDowell, [[Ph.D.]]  | first =  Michael   | coauthors =Nathan Robert Brown   | title = World Religions at Your Fingertips | publisher =Alpha  | year =2009  | page = 271  | isbn = 1592578462}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The authors write that &quot;The story is actually meant to be a working myth, illustrating the Scientology belief that humans were at one time spiritual beings, existing on infinite levels of intergalactic and interdimensional realities. At some point, the beings that we once were became trapped in physical reality (where we remain to this day). This is supposed to be the underlying message of the Xenu story, not that humans are &quot;possessed by aliens&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;michaelmcdowell&quot; </attr></ext> McDowell and Brown conclude that these inappropriate misconceptions about the Xenu text have had a negative impact, &quot;Such harsh statements are the reason many Scientologists now become passionately offended at even the mention of Xenu by nonmembers.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;michaelmcdowell&quot; </attr></ext>

[[Free speech]] lawyer [[Mike Godwin]] analyzes actions by the Scientology organization to protect and keep secret the Xenu text, within a discussion in his book ''[[Cyber Rights]]'' about the application of [[trade secret]] law on the [[Internet]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;mikegodwin&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book | last = Godwin | first = Mike | authorlink =Mike Godwin  | year = 2003 | title = [[Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age]] | publisher = MIT Press|pages=217–218 | isbn = 0262571684}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Godwin explains, &quot;trade secret law protects the information itself, not merely its particular expression. Trade secret law, unlike copyright, can protect ideas and facts directly.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;mikegodwin&quot; </attr></ext> He puts forth the question, &quot;But did the material really qualify as 'trade secrets'? Among the material the church has been trying to suppress is what might be called a 'genesis myth of Scientology': a story about a galactic despot named Xenu who decided 75 million years ago to kill a bunch of people by chaining them to volcanoes and dropping nuclear bombs on them.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;mikegodwin&quot; </attr></ext> Godwin asks, &quot;Does a 'church' normally have 'competitors' in the trade secret sense? If the Catholics got hold of the full facts about Xenu, does this mean they'll get more market share?&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;mikegodwin&quot; </attr></ext> He comments on the ability of the Scientology organization to utilize such laws in order to contain its secret texts, &quot;It seems likely, given what we know about the case now, that even a combination of copyright and trade secret law wouldn't accomplish what the church would like to accomplish: the total suppression of any dissemination of church documents or doctrines.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;mikegodwin&quot; </attr></ext> The author concludes, &quot;But the fact that the church was unlikely to gain any complete legal victories in its cases didn't mean that they wouldn't litigate. It's indisputable that the mere threat of litigation, or the costs of actual litigation, may accomplish what the legal theories alone do not: the effective silencing of many critics of the church.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;mikegodwin&quot; </attr></ext>
