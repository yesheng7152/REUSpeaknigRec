Hubbard wrote that Xenu was the ruler of a Galactic Confederacy 75 million years ago, which consisted of 26 stars and 76 planets including Earth, which was then known as "Teegeeack".<ref name="partridge" /><ref name="lamont49" /><ref name="reece">{{Harvnb|Reece|2007|pp=182–186}}</ref> The planets were overpopulated, with an average population of 178 billion.<ref name=lewis1/><ref name=thmill/><ref name=scott1/> The Galactic Confederacy's civilization was comparable to our own, with aliens "walking around in clothes which looked very remarkably like the clothes they wear this very minute" and using cars, trains and boats looking exactly the same as those "circa 1950, 1960" on Earth.<ref name="assists" />

Xenu was about to be deposed from power, so he devised a plot to eliminate the excess population from his dominions. With the assistance of [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]], he summoned billions<ref name=thmill/><ref name="partridge" /> of his citizens together under the pretense of [[income tax]] inspections, then paralyzed them and froze them in a mixture of [[ethanol|alcohol]] and [[ethylene glycol|glycol]] to capture their souls. The kidnapped populace was loaded into spacecraft for transport to the site of extermination, the planet of Teegeeack ([[Earth]]).<ref name="partridge" /> The appearance of these spacecraft would later be subconsciously expressed in the design of the [[Douglas DC-8]], the only difference being: "the DC8 had fans, propellers on it and the space plane didn't".<ref name="nightline">{{cite news| title= Scientology Leader Gave ABC First-Ever Interview&nbsp;– ABC Interview Transcript |date=November 18, 2006 | url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Story?id=2664713|work=[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|last=[[ABC News]]|accessdate = 2008-08-02}}</ref> When they had reached Teegeeack/Earth, the paralyzed citizens were unloaded around the bases of volcanoes across the planet.<ref name="partridge" /><ref name="lamont49" /> [[Nuclear weapon#Fusion bombs|Hydrogen bombs]] were then lowered into the volcanoes and detonated simultaneously.<ref name="lamont49" /> Only a few aliens' physical bodies survived. Hubbard described the scene in his film script, ''[[Revolt in the Stars]]'':

{{quotation|Simultaneously, the planted charges erupted. Atomic blasts ballooned from the craters of [[Mauna Loa|Loa]], [[Vesuvius]], [[Mount Shasta|Shasta]], [[Mount Washington (Oregon)|Washington]], [[Mount Fuji|Fujiyama]], [[Mount Etna|Etna]], and many, many others. Arching higher and higher, up and outwards, towering clouds mushroomed, shot through with flashes of flame, waste and fission. Great winds raced tumultuously across the face of Earth, spreading tales of destruction...|L. Ron Hubbard, ''Revolt in the Stars''<ref name="savino" />}}

The now-disembodied victims' souls, which Hubbard called ''[[thetan]]s'', were blown into the air by the blast. They were captured by Xenu's forces using an "electronic ribbon" ("which also was a type of [[standing wave]]") and sucked into "vacuum zones" around the world. The hundreds of billions<ref name="partridge" /><ref>A billion in [[Long and short scales|Short Scale]] is a thousand million in Long Scale.</ref> of captured thetans were taken to a type of [[movie theater|cinema]], where they were forced to watch a "[[3-D film|three-D]], super colossal motion picture" for thirty-six days. This implanted what Hubbard termed "various misleading data"' (collectively termed the R6 [[implant (Scientology)|implant]]) into the memories of the hapless thetans, "which has to do with [[God]], the [[Devil]], [[Space opera in Scientology doctrine|space opera]], et cetera". This included all [[Major religious groups|world religions]], with Hubbard specifically attributing [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and the image of the [[Crucifixion]] to the influence of Xenu. The two "implant stations" cited by Hubbard were said to have been located on Hawaii and [[Las Palmas (province)|Las Palmas]] in the [[Canary Islands]].<ref name="corydon1987">{{Harvnb|Corydon|Hubbard, Jr.|1987|pp=364–367}}</ref>

In addition to implanting new beliefs in the thetans, the images deprived them of their sense of [[Identity (social science)|personal identity]]. When the thetans left the projection areas, they started to cluster together in groups of a few thousand, having lost the ability to differentiate between each other. Each cluster of thetans gathered into one of the few remaining bodies that survived the explosion. These became what are known as ''[[body thetan]]s'', which are said to be still clinging to and adversely affecting everyone except those Scientologists who have performed the necessary steps to remove them.<ref name="lamont49" />

A government faction known as the Loyal Officers finally overthrew Xenu and his renegades, and locked him away in "an electronic mountain trap" from which he still has not escaped.<ref name="urban2006" /><ref name="reece" /><ref name="listener" /> Although the location of Xenu is sometimes said to be the [[Pyrenees]] on Earth, this is actually the location Hubbard gave elsewhere for an ancient "Martian report station".<ref>{{cite book | last =Rolph | first =C.

== Scientology doctrine ==
Within Scientology, the Xenu story is referred to as "The Wall of Fire" or "Incident II".<ref name="savino" /><ref name="lamont49">{{Harvnb|Lamont|1986|pp=49–50}}</ref> Hubbard attached tremendous importance to it, saying that it constituted "the secrets of a disaster which resulted in the decay of life as we know it in this sector of the galaxy".<ref name="miller266"/> The broad outlines of the story—that 75 million years ago a great catastrophe happened in this sector of the galaxy which caused profoundly negative effects for everyone since then—are publicly admitted to lower-level Scientologists. However, the details are kept strictly confidential, at least within Scientology.

The OT III document describes how Hubbard entered the Wall of Fire but emerged alive, "probably the only one ever to do so in 75,000,000 years".<ref name="corydon1987" /> He first publicly announced his "breakthrough" in ''Ron's Journal 67'' (''RJ67''), a taped lecture Hubbard recorded on September 20, 1967, to be sent to all Scientologists.<ref name="nightline" /> According to Hubbard, his research was achieved at the cost of a broken back, knee and arm. OT III contains a warning that the R6 implant is "calculated to kill (by pneumonia etc) anyone who attempts to solve it".<ref name="koff1988" /><ref name="corydon1987" />  Hubbard claimed that his "tech development"—i.e. his OT materials—had neutralized this threat, creating a safe path to redemption.<ref name="lamont49" /><ref name="corydon364" />

The Church of Scientology forbade individuals from reading the OT III Xenu [[cosmogony]] without first having taken prerequisite courses.<ref name="browne">{{cite journal  | last = Browne  | first = Michael  | title = Should Germany Stop Worrying and Love the Octopus?

Int'l & Comp. L. Rev. 155  | ref = harv }}</ref> Scientologists warn that reading the Xenu story without proper authorization could cause pneumonia.<ref name="browne" /><ref name="allen">{{cite news   | last = Allen  | first = Mike  | title = Internet Gospel: Scientology's Expensive Wisdom Now Comes Free  | newspaper = [[The New York Times]]  | publisher = [[The New York Times Company]]  | date = August 20, 1995 }}</ref>

In ''RJ67'',<ref name="nightline" /> Hubbard then alludes to the devastating effect of Xenu's genocide:
{{cquote|And it is very true that a great catastrophe occurred on this planet and in the other 75 planets which formed this [Galactic] Confederacy 75 million years ago. It has since that time been a desert, and it has been the lot of just a handful to try to push its technology up to a level where someone might adventure forward, penetrate the catastrophe, and undo it. We're well on our way to making this occur.}}

OT III also deals with ''Incident I'', set four [[1,000,000,000,000,000|quadrillion]]<ref>Four thousand billion in [[Long and short scales|Long Scale]].</ref> years ago. In ''Incident I'', the unsuspecting thetan was subjected to a loud snapping noise followed by a flood of luminescence, then saw a [[chariot]] followed by a trumpeting [[cherub]]. After a loud set of snaps, the thetan was overwhelmed by darkness. This is described as the implant offering the gateway to this universe, meaning that these traumatic memories are what separate thetans from their static (natural, godlike) state.

Hubbard uses the existence of body thetans to explain many of the physical and mental ailments of humanity which, he says, prevent people from achieving their highest spiritual levels.<ref name="lamont49" /> OT III tells the Scientologist to locate body thetans and release them from the effects of Incidents I and II by auditing them.<ref name="lamont49" /> This is accomplished in solo auditing, where the Scientologist holds both cans of an [[E-meter]] in one hand and asks questions as an auditor. The Scientologist is directed to find a cluster of body thetans, address it [[telepathy|telepathically]] as a cluster and take first the cluster then each individual member of the cluster through Incident II, then Incident I if needed.<ref name="lamont49" /> Hubbard warns that this is a painstaking procedure, and that OT levels IV to VII are necessary to continue the long process of dealing with one's body thetans.

The Church of Scientology has objected to the Xenu story being used to paint Scientology as a mere [[science fiction]] fantasy<ref name="Observer 2004">{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,1217884,00.html| publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|work=The Observer| title=Lure of the celebrity sect: During an exclusive tour of Scientology's Celebrity Centre, Jamie Doward quizzed personnel about the church's teachings|date=May 16, 2004|accessdate=2008-12-03| first=Jamie| last= Doward}}</ref> (see [[Space opera in Scientology doctrine]]).

{{cquote|Everyman is then shown to have been crucified so don't think that it's an accident that this crucifixion, they found out that this applied.

The man on the Cross. There was no [[Christ]]. But the man on the cross is shown as Everyman.}}

== Origins of the story ==
Hubbard wrote OT III in late 1966 and early 1967 in [[North Africa]] while on his way to [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria|Las Palmas]] to join the ''Enchanter'', the first vessel of his private Scientology fleet (the "[[Sea Org]]").<ref name="miller266">{{Harvnb|Miller|1988|p=266}}</ref> (OT III says "In December 1967 I knew someone had to take the plunge", but the material was publicised well before this.) He emphasized later that OT III was his own personal discovery.

Critics of Scientology have suggested that other factors may have been at work. In a letter of the time to his wife [[Mary Sue Hubbard|Mary Sue]],<ref name="corydon58">{{Harvnb|Corydon|Hubbard, Jr.|1987|pp=58–59, 332–333}}</ref> Hubbard said that, in order to assist his research, he was drinking alcohol and taking [[stimulant]]s and [[depressant]]s ("I'm drinking lots of rum and popping pinks and greys"). His assistant at the time, Virginia Downsborough, said that she had to wean him off the diet of drugs to which he had become accustomed.<ref name="atack171">{{Harvnb|Atack|1990|p=171}}</ref> Russell Miller posits in ''[[Bare-faced Messiah]]'' that it was important for Hubbard to be found in a debilitated condition, so as to present OT III as "a research accomplishment of immense magnitude".<ref name="miller290">{{Harvnb|Miller|1988|p=290}}</ref>

Elements of the Xenu story appeared in Scientology before OT III. Hubbard's descriptions of extraterrestrial conflicts were put forward as early as 1950 in his book ''Have You Lived Before This Life?'', and were enthusiastically endorsed by Scientologists who documented their [[Reincarnation|past lives]] on other planets.<ref name="partridge" />

== Influence of OT III on Scientology ==
[[Image:LRonHubbard-Dianetics-ISBN1403105464-cover.jpg|thumb|upright|The volcano and fireball on the cover of ''Dianetics'' refers to the Xenu story.<ref name="savino" />]]
The 1968 and subsequent reprints of ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health|Dianetics]]'' have had covers depicting an exploding volcano, which is reportedly a reference to OT III.<ref name="savino" /><ref name="corydon1987" /> In a 1968 lecture, and in instructions to his marketing staff, Hubbard explained that these images would "key in" the submerged memories of Incident II and impel people to buy the books.<ref name="assists">L.

Since the 1980s, the volcano has also been depicted in [[Television advertisement|television commercials]] advertising ''Dianetics''. Scientology's "[[Sea Org]]", an elite group within the church that originated with Hubbard's personal staff aboard his fleet of ships, takes many of its symbols from the story of Xenu and OT III. It is explicitly intended to be a revival of the "Loyal Officers" who overthrew Xenu. Its logo, a wreath with 26 leaves, represents the 26 stars of Xenu's Galactic Confederacy.<ref>Hubbard, "Ron's Talk to Pubs Org World Wide", tape of April 1968</ref> According to an official Scientology dictionary, "the Sea Org symbol, adopted and used as the symbol of a Galactic Confederacy far back in the history of this sector, derives much of its power and authority from that association".<ref>{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=Lafayette Ronald| coauthors=LRH Personal Secretary Office| title=Modern Management Technology Defined: Hubbard Dictionary of Administration and Management |year=1976 |isbn=0884040402|publisher=Church of Scientology of California|page=467}}</ref>

In the Advanced Orgs in [[Edinburgh]] and [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], Scientology staff were at one time ordered to wear all-white uniforms with silver boots, to mimic Xenu's Galactic Patrol as depicted on the cover of ''[[Dianetics: The Evolution of a Science]]''. This was reportedly done on the basis of Hubbard's declaration in his Flag Order 652 that mankind would accept regulation from that group which had last betrayed it—hence the imitation of Xenu's henchmen. (This was almost certainly a misinterpretation of what Hubbard meant—he was most likely referring to [[psychiatry|psychiatrists]], whom he believed had played a key role in Xenu's crimes.) In Los Angeles, a nightwatch was ordered to watch for returning spaceships.<ref name="atack190">{{Harvnb|Atack|1990|p=190}}</ref>

== "Xenu" or "Xemu"? ==
[[Image:Xenu-LRH-handwriting.png|frame|right|The manuscript of OT III contains the only known example of Xenu's name in Hubbard's handwriting.]]

In the "Assists" lecture, Hubbard speaks of ''"Xenu, ahhh, could be spelled X-E-M-U"'' and clearly says "Xemu" several times on the recording.<ref name="assists" /> The treatment of ''Revolt in the Stars''—which is typewritten—uses ''Xenu'' exclusively.<ref>{{cite book

== Church of Scientology's position ==
In its public statements, the Church of Scientology has been reluctant to allow any mention of Xenu. A passing mention by a trial judge in 1997 prompted the Church's lawyers to have the ruling  [[Record sealing|sealed]], although this was reversed.<ref>{{cite news|last=Prendergast|first=Alan|work=Denver Westword |title=Nightmare on the net: A web of intrigue surrounds the high-stakes legal brawl between FACTnet and the Church of Scientology|date=March 6, 1997| url=http://www.westword.com/1997-03-06/news/nightmare-on-the-net/ |accessdate=2008-12-03|publisher=[[Village Voice Media]]}}</ref> In the relatively few instances in which it has acknowledged Xenu, Scientology has stated the story is a religious writing that can be seen as the equivalent of the [[Old Testament]]—in which miraculous events are described that are unlikely to have occurred in real life, assuming true meaning only after years of study.

Senior members of the Church of Scientology have several times publicly denied or minimized the importance of the Xenu story, but others have admitted its existence. In 1995, Scientology lawyer Earl Cooley hinted at the importance of Xenu in Scientology doctrine by stating that "thousands of articles are written about [[Coca-Cola]], and they don't print the [[Coca-Cola formula|formula for Coca-Cola]]".<ref>{{cite news | last=Hall | first=Charles W. | title=Court Lets Newspaper Keep Scientology Texts | publisher =Seattle Times | date=August 31, 1995 | url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950831&slug=2139173 | accessdate = 2009-09-08}}</ref> Scientology has many graduated levels through which one can progress.

== Leaking of the story ==
Despite the Church of Scientology's efforts to keep the story secret, details have been leaked over the years. OT III was first revealed in Robert Kaufman's 1972 book ''[[Inside Scientology: How I Joined Scientology and Became Superhuman|Inside Scientology]]'', in which Kaufman detailed his own experiences of OT III.<ref name="kaufmanIII">{{Harvard citation no brackets |Kaufman|1972|loc =Part III}}</ref> It was later described in a 1981 Clearwater ''Sun'' article,<ref>{{cite journal| last =Leiby | first = Richard | title = Sect courses resemble science fiction | journal = Clearwater Sun | volume = 68 | issue=118 | date = August 30, 1981| ref =harv}}</ref> and came to greater public fame in a 1985 court case brought against Scientology by [[Lawrence Wollersheim]]. The church failed to have the documents sealed<ref name="koff1988" /> and attempted to keep the case file checked out by a reader at all times, but the story was summarized in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''<ref>{{cite news|last = Sappell | first = Joel | coauthors = Robert W.

On December 24, 1994, the Xenu story was published on the Internet for the first time in a posting to the [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] [[alt.religion.scientology]], through an [[anonymous remailer]].<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|The Skeptic]]|publisher=[[The Skeptics Society]]|last=Lippard|first=Jim|authorlink=Jim Lippard|url=http://www.discord.org/~lippard/skeptic/03.3.jl-jj-scientology.html |title=Scientology v. the Internet: Free Speech & Copyright Infringement on the Information Super-Highway |accessdate=2008-11-29|volume=3|issue=3|year=1995|pages=35–41|ref=harv}}</ref> This led to an [[Scientology versus the Internet|online battle between Church of Scientology lawyers and detractors]]. Older versions of OT levels I to VII were brought as exhibits attached to a declaration by [[Steven Fishman]] on April 9, 1993, as part of ''Church of Scientology International v.

There was a [[copyright]] raid on Lerma's house (leading to massive [[Mirror (computing)|mirroring]] of the documents)<ref>{{cite news|last=Grossman|first=Wendy| title=Scientologists Fight On |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=August 17, 1995|page=2}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Brown|title=Let's All Beam Up To Heaven|work=[[The Independent]]|date=May 2, 1996|page=17|quote=The group responded with a campaign of raids and seizures around the US, claiming that these documents were copyrighted trade secrets.

The Church of Scientology's attempts to keep Xenu under wraps have been cited in court findings against it. In September 2003, a Dutch court, in a ruling in the case against Karin Spaink, stated that one objective in keeping OT II and OT III secret was to wield power over members of the Church of Scientology and prevent discussion about its teachings and practices:<ref>{{cite news | last =The Court of Justice at The Hague | title =LJN: AI5638, Gerechtshof 's-Gravenhage , 99/1040 | work =de Rechtspraak | page =Section 8.4 | language =Dutch | publisher =zoeken.rechtspraak.nl | date =September 4, 2003 | url =http://zoeken.rechtspraak.nl/resultpage.aspx?snelzoeken=true&searchtype=ljn&ljn=AI5638&u_ljn=AI5638 | accessdate = 2008-12-01 |quote=Uit de hiervoor onder 8.3 vermelde teksten blijkt dat Scientology c.s. met hun leer en organisatie de verwerping van democratische waarden niet schuwen.

Versions of the Xenu story have appeared in both television shows and stage productions. The [[Off-Broadway]] [[satire|satirical]] musical ''[[A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant]]'', first staged in 2003 and winner of an [[Obie Award]] in 2004, featured children in alien costumes telling the story of Xenu.<ref>{{cite news|first=David|last=Rooney |work=Variety|date=December 10, 2006|title=Theatre Review: A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117932286.html?categoryid=33&cs=1|accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref><!-- commons picture at http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:2007_A_Very_Merry_Xenu.jpg-->

==Commentary==

Writing in the book ''[[Scientology (James R. Lewis book)|Scientology]]'' published by [[Oxford University Press]], contributor [[Mikael Rothstein]] observes that, "To my knowledge no real analysis of Scientology's Xenu myth has appeared in scholarly publications. The most sober and enlightening text about the Xenu myth is probably the article on Wikipedia (English version) and, even if brief, Andreas Grünschloss's piece on Scientology in Lewis (2000: 266–268)."<ref name="rothstein" /> Rothstein places the Xenu text by L. Ron Hubbard within the context of a [[creation myth]] within the Scientology methodology, and characterizes it as "one of Scientology's more important religious narratives, the text that apparently constitutes the basic (sometimes implicit) mythology of the movement, the ''Xenu myth'', which is basically a story of the origin of man on Earth and the human condition."<ref name="rothstein">{{Cite book  | last=Rothstein|first=Mikael|editor-last =[[James R.

[[Andreas Grünschloß]] analyzes the Xenu text in ''The Oxford Handbook of New Religious Movements'', within the context of a discussion on [[UFO religion]]s.<ref name="OxfordHandbook" /> He characterizes the text as "Scientology's secret mythology (contained especially in the OT III teachings)".<ref name="OxfordHandbook" /> Grünschloß points out that L. Ron Hubbard, "also wrote a science fiction story called ''Revolt in the Stars'', where he displays this otherwise arcane story about the ancient ruler Xenu in the form of an ordinary science fiction novel".<ref name="OxfordHandbook" /> Grünschloß posits, "because of the connections between several motifs in Hubbard's novels and specific Scientology teachings, one might perceive Scientology as one of the rare instances where science fiction (or fantasy literature generally) is related to the successful formation of a new spiritual movement."<ref name="OxfordHandbook" /> Comparing the fusion between the two genres of Hubbard's science fiction writing and Scientology creation myth, Grünschloß writes, "Although the science fiction novels are of a different genre than other 'techno-logical' disclosures of Hubbard, they are highly appreciated by participants, and Hubbard's literary output in this realm (including the latest movie, ''Battlefield Earth'') is also well promoted by the organization."<ref name="OxfordHandbook" /> Writing in the book ''UFO Religions'' edited by [[Christopher Partridge]], Grünschloß observes, "the enthusiasm for ufology and science fiction was cultivated in the formative phase of Scientology. Indeed, even the highly arcane story of the intergalactic ruler Xenu ... is related by Hubbard in the style of a simple science fiction novel".<ref name="partridge187">{{Harvnb|Partridge|2003|pp=187–188}}</ref>

Several authors have pointed out structural similarities between the Xenu story and the mythology of [[gnosticism]]. James A. Herrick, writing about the Xenu text in ''The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition'', notes that "Hubbard's gnostic leanings are evident in his account of human origins [...] In Hubbard, ideas first expressed in science fiction are seamlessly transformed into a worldwide religion with affinities to gnosticism."<ref name="Herrick2004">{{cite book|author=James A. Herrick|title=The Making of the New Spirituality: The Eclipse of the Western Religious Tradition|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KzbobUhvpf4C&pg=PA199|accessdate=24 January 2011|date=December 2004|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=9780830832798|page=199}}</ref> Mary Farrell Bednarowski, writing in ''America's Alternative Religions'', similarly states that the outline of the Xenu mythology is "not totally unfamiliar to the historian acquainted with ancient gnosticism", noting that many other religious traditions have the practice of reserving certain texts to high-level initiates.<ref name="Miller1995" /> Nevertheless, she writes, the Xenu story arouses suspicion in the public about Scientology and adds fuel to "the claims that Hubbard's system is the product of his creativity as a science fiction writer rather than a theologian."<ref name="Miller1995">{{cite book|author=Mary Farrell Bednarowski|editor=Timothy Miller|title=America's Alternative Religions|chapter=The Church of Scientology: Lightning Rod for Cultural Boundary Conflicts|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=y3Mt7QlXrRwC&pg=PA389|accessdate=24 January 2011|year=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791423981|page=389}}</ref>

Authors Michael McDowell and Nathan Robert Brown discuss misconceptions about the Xenu text in their book ''World Religions at Your Fingertips'', and observe, "Probably the most controversial, misunderstood, and frequently misrepresented part of the Scientology religion has to do with a Scientology myth commonly referred to as the Legend of Xenu. While this story has now been undoubtedly proven a part of the religion (despite the fact that church representatives often deny its existence), the story's true role in Scientology is often misrepresented by its critics as proof that they 'believe in alien parasites.' While the story may indeed seem odd, this is simply not the case."<ref name="michaelmcdowell">{{cite book| last =McDowell, [[Ph.D.]]  | first =  Michael   | coauthors =Nathan Robert Brown   | title = World Religions at Your Fingertips | publisher =Alpha  | year =2009  | page = 271  | isbn = 1592578462}}</ref> The authors write that "The story is actually meant to be a working myth, illustrating the Scientology belief that humans were at one time spiritual beings, existing on infinite levels of intergalactic and interdimensional realities. At some point, the beings that we once were became trapped in physical reality (where we remain to this day). This is supposed to be the underlying message of the Xenu story, not that humans are "possessed by aliens".<ref name="michaelmcdowell" /> McDowell and Brown conclude that these inappropriate misconceptions about the Xenu text have had a negative impact, "Such harsh statements are the reason many Scientologists now become passionately offended at even the mention of Xenu by nonmembers."<ref name="michaelmcdowell" />

[[Free speech]] lawyer [[Mike Godwin]] analyzes actions by the Scientology organization to protect and keep secret the Xenu text, within a discussion in his book ''[[Cyber Rights]]'' about the application of [[trade secret]] law on the [[Internet]].<ref name="mikegodwin">{{cite book | last = Godwin | first = Mike | authorlink =Mike Godwin  | year = 2003 | title = [[Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age]] | publisher = MIT Press|pages=217–218 | isbn = 0262571684}}</ref> Godwin explains, "trade secret law protects the information itself, not merely its particular expression. Trade secret law, unlike copyright, can protect ideas and facts directly."<ref name="mikegodwin" /> He puts forth the question, "But did the material really qualify as 'trade secrets'? Among the material the church has been trying to suppress is what might be called a 'genesis myth of Scientology': a story about a galactic despot named Xenu who decided 75 million years ago to kill a bunch of people by chaining them to volcanoes and dropping nuclear bombs on them."<ref name="mikegodwin" /> Godwin asks, "Does a 'church' normally have 'competitors' in the trade secret sense? If the Catholics got hold of the full facts about Xenu, does this mean they'll get more market share?"<ref name="mikegodwin" /> He comments on the ability of the Scientology organization to utilize such laws in order to contain its secret texts, "It seems likely, given what we know about the case now, that even a combination of copyright and trade secret law wouldn't accomplish what the church would like to accomplish: the total suppression of any dissemination of church documents or doctrines."<ref name="mikegodwin" /> The author concludes, "But the fact that the church was unlikely to gain any complete legal victories in its cases didn't mean that they wouldn't litigate. It's indisputable that the mere threat of litigation, or the costs of actual litigation, may accomplish what the legal theories alone do not: the effective silencing of many critics of the church."<ref name="mikegodwin" />
