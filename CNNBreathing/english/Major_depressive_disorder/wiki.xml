<comment>&lt;!--first para: general note on etymology and importance and severity of condition --&gt;
</comment>'''Major depressive disorder''' ('''MDD''') (also known as '''clinical depression''', '''major depression''', '''unipolar depression''', or '''unipolar disorder'''; or as '''recurrent depression''' in the case of repeated episodes) is a [[mental disorder]] characterized by a pervasive and persistent [[depression (mood)|low mood]] that is accompanied by low [[self-esteem]] and by a [[anhedonia|loss of interest or pleasure]] in normally enjoyable activities. The term &quot;depression&quot; is used in a number of different ways. It is often used to mean this syndrome but may refer to other mood disorders or simple to a low mood. Major depressive disorder is a disabling condition that adversely affects a person's family, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health. In the United States, around 3.4% of people with major depression commit [[suicide]], and up to 60% of people who commit suicide had depression or another mood disorder.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;IntegrativeSuicide&quot;</attr></ext>

<comment>&lt;!-- diagnosis --&gt;
</comment>The diagnosis of major depressive disorder is based on the patient's self-reported experiences, behavior reported by relatives or friends, and a [[mental status examination]]. There is no laboratory test for major depression, although physicians generally request tests for physical conditions that may cause similar symptoms. The most common time of onset is between the ages of 20 and 30 years, with a later peak between 30 and 40 years.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://www.health.am/psy/major-depressive-disorder/|title=Major Depressive Disorder|publisher=American Medical Network, Inc.|accessdate=15 January 2011}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<comment>&lt;!--treatment and course --&gt;
</comment>Typically, people are treated with [[antidepressant]] [[Pharmaceutical drug|medication]] and, in many cases, also receive counseling, particularly [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT). <ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>Driessen, Ellen; Hollon, Steven D.

A minority are treated with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT). The course of the disorder varies widely, from one episode lasting weeks to a lifelong disorder with recurrent [[major depressive episode]]s. Depressed individuals have shorter [[Life expectancy|life expectancies]] than those without depression, in part because of greater susceptibility to medical illnesses and suicide. It is unclear whether or not medications affect the risk of suicide. Current and former patients may be [[Social stigma|stigmatized]].

<comment>&lt;!-- history and discussion of nature and causes--&gt;
</comment>The understanding of the nature and causes of depression has evolved over the centuries, though this understanding is incomplete and has left many aspects of depression as the subject of discussion and research. Proposed causes include [[Psychology|psychological]], psycho-social, [[heredity|hereditary]], [[evolution]]ary and [[biology|biological]] factors. Long-term [[substance abuse]] may cause or worsen depressive symptoms. Psychological treatments are based on theories of [[Personality theory|personality]], [[Communication theory|interpersonal communication]], and [[learning theory (education)|learning]]. Most biological theories focus on the [[monoamine neurotransmitter|monoamine]] chemicals [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]], which are naturally present in the [[Human brain|brain]] and assist communication between [[Neuron|nerve cells]]. This cluster of symptoms ([[syndrome]]) was named, described and classified as one of the [[mood disorder]]s in the 1980 edition of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|diagnostic manual]].

Depression and [[pain]] often co-occur.

Depression is also associated with a 1.5- to 2-fold increased risk of [[cardiovascular disease]], independent of other known risk factors, and is itself linked directly or indirectly to risk factors such as smoking and obesity.

These interactive models have gained [[empirical]] support.

<h level="4" i="5">====Monoamine hypothesis====</h>
[[Image:Synapse Illustration2 tweaked.svg|thumb|250px|Of approx. 30 [[neurotransmitters]] that have been identified, researchers have discovered associations between clinical depression and the function of three major [[neurochemicals]]. These substances are [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]], and [[dopamine]]. Antidepressants influence the overall balance of these three neurotransmitters within structures of the brain that regulate emotion, reactions to stress, and the physical drives of sleep, appetite, and sexuality.<template><title>mcn</title><part><name>date</name><equals>=</equals><value>January 2014</value></part></template>]]

Most [[antidepressant]] medications increase the levels of one or more of the monoamines—the neurotransmitters [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]]—in the [[Chemical synapse|synaptic cleft]] between [[neuron]]s in the brain. Some medications affect the monoamine receptors directly.

Serotonin is hypothesized to regulate other neurotransmitter systems; decreased serotonin activity may allow these systems to act in unusual and erratic ways.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;IntegrativeSerotonin&quot;</attr><inner>{{Harvnb|Barlow|2005| p=226}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> According to this &quot;permissive hypothesis&quot;, depression arises when low serotonin levels promote low levels of norepinephrine, another monoamine neurotransmitter.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web |author=Shah N, Eisner T, Farrell M, Raeder C|date=July–August 1999 |url=http://www.pswi.org/professional/pharmaco/depression.pdf |title=An overview of SSRIs for the treatment of depression |work=Journal of the Pharmacy Society of Wisconsin |accessdate=10 November 2008| format=PDF}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Some antidepressants enhance the levels of norepinephrine directly, whereas others raise the levels of dopamine, a third monoamine neurotransmitter. These observations gave rise to the [[monoamine hypothesis]] of depression. In its contemporary formulation, the monoamine hypothesis postulates that a deficiency of certain neurotransmitters is responsible for the corresponding features of depression: &quot;Norepinephrine may be related to alertness and energy as well as anxiety, attention, and interest in life; [lack of] serotonin to anxiety, obsessions, and compulsions; and dopamine to attention, motivation, pleasure, and reward, as well as interest in life.&quot;<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;pmid18494537&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite journal |author=Nutt DJ |title=Relationship of neurotransmitters to the symptoms of major depressive disorder |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |volume=69 Suppl E1 |pages=4–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18494537}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The proponents of this theory recommend the choice of an antidepressant with mechanism of action that impacts the most prominent symptoms.

Depression can be caused by prejudice. This can occur when people hold negative self-stereotypes about themselves. This &quot;deprejudice&quot; can be related to a group membership (e.g., Me-Gay-Bad) or not (Me-Bad). If someone has prejudicial beliefs about a stigmatized group and then becomes a member of that group, they may internalize their prejudice and develop depression. For example, a boy growing up in the United States may learn the negative stereotype that gay men are immoral. When he grows up and realizes he is gay, he may direct this prejudice inward on himself and become depressed. People may also show prejudice internalization through self-stereotyping because of negative childhood experiences such as verbal and physical abuse.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Cox et al.

From another viewpoint, a counseling therapist may see depression not as a biochemical illness or disorder but as &quot;a species-wide evolved suite of emotional programs that are mostly activated by a perception, almost always over-negative, of a major decline in personal usefulness, that can sometimes be linked to guilt, shame or perceived rejection&quot;.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Carey05&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite journal |title=Evolution, depression and counselling |journal=Counselling Psychology Quarterly|year=2005 |author=Carey TJ |volume=18|issue=3 |pages=215–22 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/ccpq/2005/00000018/00000003/art00005 |doi=10.1080/09515070500304508}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> This suite may have manifested in aging hunters in humans' [[foraging]] past, who were marginalized by their declining skills, and may continue to appear in [[Social alienation|alienated members]] of today's society.

<h level="4" i="15">====Subtypes====</h>
The DSM-IV-TR recognizes five further subtypes of MDD, called ''specifiers'', in addition to noting the length, severity and presence of psychotic features:

*'''[[Melancholic depression]]''' is characterized by a loss of pleasure in most or all activities, a failure of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, a quality of depressed mood more pronounced than that of [[grief]] or loss, a worsening of symptoms in the morning hours, early-morning waking, [[psychomotor retardation]], excessive weight loss (not to be confused with [[anorexia nervosa]]), or excessive guilt.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a| pp=419–20}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>
*'''[[Atypical depression]]''' is characterized by mood reactivity (paradoxical anhedonia) and positivity, significant [[weight gain]] or increased appetite (comfort eating), excessive sleep or sleepiness ([[hypersomnia]]), a sensation of heaviness in limbs known as leaden paralysis, and significant social impairment as a consequence of hypersensitivity to perceived [[social rejection|interpersonal rejection]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{Harvnb |American Psychiatric Association|2000a|pp=421–22}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>
*'''[[Catatonia|Catatonic]] depression''' is a rare and severe form of major depression involving disturbances of motor behavior and other symptoms.

To confer major depressive disorder as the most likely diagnosis, other [[Differential diagnosis|potential diagnoses]] must be considered, including dysthymia, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, or bipolar disorder. [[Dysthymia]] is a chronic, milder mood disturbance in which a person reports a low mood almost daily over a span of at least two years. The symptoms are not as severe as those for major depression, although people with dysthymia are vulnerable to secondary episodes of major depression (sometimes referred to as ''double depression'').<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;harvnb&quot;</attr></ext> [[Adjustment disorder|Adjustment disorder with depressed mood]] is a mood disturbance appearing as a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;psychiatric355&quot;</attr></ext> [[Bipolar disorder]], also known as ''manic–depressive disorder'', is a condition in which depressive phases alternate with periods of mania or [[hypomania]].

Other disorders need to be ruled out before diagnosing major depressive disorder. They include depressions due to physical illness, [[medications]], and [[substance abuse]]. Depression due to physical illness is diagnosed as a [[mood disorder]] due to a general medical condition. This condition is determined based on history, laboratory findings, or [[physical examination]]. When the depression is caused by a substance abused including a drug of abuse, a medication, or exposure to a [[toxin]], it is then diagnosed as a substance-induced mood disorder.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080715124733/http://www.psychnet-uk.com/dsm_iv/major_depression.htm| title=Major Depressive Episode|work=psychnet-uk.com|accessdate= 16 July 2010}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<template lineStart="1"><title>Main</title><part><name index="1"/><value>Management of depression</value></part></template>
The three most common clinical treatments for depression are psychotherapy, medication, and electroconvulsive therapy. Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice (over medication) for people under 18. Care is usually given on an [[Psychiatry#Outpatient treatment|outpatient]] basis, whereas treatment in an [[Psychiatry#Inpatient treatment|inpatient]] unit is considered if there is a significant risk to self or others. Other treatments include [[light therapy]], [[sleep deprivation]], [[physical exercise]], stopping smoking, [[mindfulness meditation]], and music therapy.

Treatment options are much more limited in developing countries, where access to mental health staff, medication, and psychotherapy is often difficult.

Although ''melancholia'' remained the dominant diagnostic term, ''depression'' gained increasing currency in medical treatises and was a synonym by the end of the century; German psychiatrist [[Emil Kraepelin]] may have been the first to use it as the overarching term, referring to different kinds of melancholia as ''depressive states''.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Davison2006&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite journal |last=Davison |first=K|year=2006|title=Historical aspects of mood disorders |journal=Psychiatry |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=115–18 |doi=10.1383/psyt.2006.5.4.115}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

Sigmund Freud likened the state of melancholia to mourning in his 1917 paper ''Mourning and Melancholia''. He theorized that [[object (philosophy)|objective]] loss, such as the loss of a valued relationship through death or a romantic break-up, results in [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] loss as well; the depressed individual has identified with the object of affection through an [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], [[narcissism|narcissistic]] process called the ''libidinal [[cathexis]]'' of the [[Id, ego and super-ego|ego]].

People's conceptualizations of depression vary widely, both within and among cultures. &quot;Because of the lack of scientific certainty,&quot; one commentator has observed, &quot;the debate over depression turns on questions of language.

The diagnosis is less common in some countries, such as [[People's Republic of China|China]].

</comment>Historical figures were often reluctant to discuss or seek treatment for depression due to [[social stigma]] about the condition, or due to ignorance of diagnosis or treatments.
