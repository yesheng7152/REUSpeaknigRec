'''Sophie, Countess of Wessex''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|GCVOf|DStJ}} (Sophie Helen; ''née'' '''Rhys-Jones'''; born 20 January 1965) is the wife of [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]], the youngest son of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]]. Married in 1999, she worked in [[public relations]] until 2002 and now assists her husband in his royal duties. The Earl and Countess have two children: [[James, Viscount Severn]], and [[Lady Louise Windsor]], who are respectively ninth and tenth in the [[line of succession to the British throne|line of succession]].

==Early life==
Sophie Helen Rhys-Jones was born at [[Radcliffe Infirmary]], [[Oxford]], on 20 January 1965, the second child and first daughter of Christopher Bournes Rhys-Jones (born 1931), a retired tyre salesman, and his wife, Mary ([[Maiden and married names|née]] O'Sullivan; 1934–2005), a secretary,<ref>{{cite news| title=Countess of Wessex's mother dies|publisher=BBC  | date=29 August 2005| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4194720.stm| accessdate=27 October 2008}}</ref> who already had a son, David. Sophie was named after her father's sister, Helen, who died in a riding accident more than a decade before Sophie was born. Her godfather, actor [[Thane Bettany]], is her father's stepbrother;<ref>[http://thepeerage.com/p10414.htm#i104137 Peerage genealogy]</ref> both men spent their early life in [[Sarawak]], North Borneo, then a British Protectorate ruled by the [[White Rajahs]].<ref>[http://www.tiscali.co.uk/entertainment/film/biographies/paul_bettany_biog.html Biography of Paul Bettany]</ref>

Sophie was raised in [[Brenchley]], Kent.<ref name="place"/> She began her education at [[Dulwich Preparatory School]], before moving on to [[Kent College, Pembury|Kent College]], [[Pembury]], where she was friends with Sarah Sienesi, with whom she subsequently shared a flat in Fulham and who later became her [[lady-in-waiting]]. She then trained as a secretary at [[West Kent College]], [[Tonbridge]].<ref name="place">{{cite web|title=PR girl turns princess|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/06/99/royal_wedding/363946.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=11 June 1999|accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>

==Career==
She began a career in [[public relations]], working for a variety of firms, including four years at [[Capital Radio]], where she was assigned to the press and promotions department, as well as public relations companies The Quentin Bell Organisation and MacLaurin Communications & Media. She also worked as a ski representative in Switzerland and spent a year travelling and working in Australia. In 1996, Rhys-Jones launched her public relations agency, RJH Public Relations, which she ran with her business partner, Murray Harkin.

In 2001, a ''[[News of the World]]'' undercover reporter, [[Mazher Mahmood]], posing as a [[sheikh]], recorded the Countess making disparaging comments about certain members of the [[Her Majesty's Government|British Government]] and appearing to use her royal status in order to gain clientele. The comments were subsequently published in ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' newspaper, and then by other media outlets. Buckingham Palace released a statement saying the reported comments were "selective, distorted and in several cases, flatly untrue".<ref>{{cite news|title=Palace denies reports of Sophie insults|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1255645.stm|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 July 2011|date=2 April 2001}}</ref>  Subsequently, in 2002, both the Earl and Countess announced that they would quit their business interests in order to focus on royal duties and aid the Queen in her [[Golden Jubilee]] year.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1850847.stm | work=BBC News | title=Sophie and Edward quit business roles | date=2 March 2002}}</ref>

==Marriage==

Sophie met [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex|Prince Edward]], the youngest son of the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] and the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], at a charity event in 1993, and the two began their relationship soon afterwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/events/prince_edwards_wedding |title=History - Prince Edward's wedding (pictures, video, facts & news) |publisher=BBC |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> Their engagement was announced on 6 January 1999. Edward proposed to Sophie with an engagement ring featuring a two-carat oval diamond flanked by two heart-shaped gemstones set in 18-karat white gold. This engagement ring was made by Asprey and Garrard (now Garrard & Co) and is worth an estimated £105,000.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://royalweddings.helloonline.com/prince-william-and-kate-middleton/galeria/20100922403/kate-middleton/prince-william/rings/1/11/#ancla |title=Crown jewels: The fabulous rings which sealed the love of Europe's royal couples |work=HELLO! magazine |location=UK}}</ref> The wedding took place on 19 June of the same year at [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle|St George's Chapel]] at [[Windsor Castle]], a break from the weddings of Edward's older siblings, which were large, formal events at [[Westminster Abbey]] or [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. On the day of their marriage, the Queen created Edward [[Earl of Wessex]] and [[Viscount Severn]] and declared that he would eventually be created [[Duke of Edinburgh]] once that title reverts to the Crown. After the union, the couple moved to [[Bagshot Park]], in [[Surrey]].

The couple has two children:
* [[Lady Louise Windsor]] (born 8 November 2003)
* [[James, Viscount Severn]] (born 17 December 2007)

The children, per prior agreement between the Queen and their parents, will either not have or not use (depending on interpretation) the title of Prince(ss), nor the style [[Royal Highness]].

After the death of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] in 2002, Sophie became the second highest-ranking woman in the [[Order of precedence in the United Kingdom|U.K.'s order of precedence]], preceded only by the Queen, as her brothers-in-law, the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]] and the [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|Duke of York]], were then unmarried. Due to marriages of the Prince of Wales and the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] and changes in favour of princesses by blood for private occasions, Sophie now ranks after her sisters-in-law, the [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Royal]] and the [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Duchess of Cornwall]]; her nieces, [[Princess Beatrice of York|Beatrice]] and [[Princess Eugenie of York|Eugenie]]; her niece-in-law [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Catherine]] and her mother-in-law's cousin [[Princess Alexandra, The Honourable Lady Ogilvy|Alexandra]].<ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/9351571/The-Queen-tells-the-Duchess-of-Cambridge-to-curtsy-to-the-blood-princesses.html The Queen tells the Duchess of Cambridge to curtsy to the 'blood princesses’]</ref> At official occasions, however, she ranks third, behind only her mother-in-law and sister-in-law.

In December 2001, the Countess was taken to the King Edward VII Hospital after feeling unwell, whereupon it was discovered that she was suffering from a potentially life-threatening [[ectopic pregnancy]]. Two years later, on 8 November 2003, she prematurely gave birth to her daughter, Louise, resulting from a sudden [[placental abruption]] that placed both mother and child at risk, and the Countess had to undergo an emergency [[caesarean section]] at [[Frimley Park Hospital]], while the Earl of Wessex rushed back from [[Mauritius]]. The Countess returned to Frimley Park Hospital on 17 December 2007, to give birth, again by caesarean section, to her son, James, Viscount Severn.<ref name="BBC birth">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7148830.stm| title=Countess gives birth to baby boy|publisher=BBC  | date=17 December 2007| accessdate=27 October 2008}}</ref>

The Countess of Wessex began to take on royal duties after her wedding, with her first overseas tour being to the Canadian province of [[Prince Edward Island]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite journal| last=Scott| first=Burke| coauthors=[[John Aimers|Aimers, John]]| title=Wessexs' Tour a Triumph| journal=Canadian Monarchist News| issue=Autumn 2001| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| date=October 2001| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/cmn/2001/wessex.htm| accessdate=27 October 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> She also became [[Patronage|patron]] of a number of organisations, including the SAFC Foundation (the charitable arm of [[Sunderland A.F.C.]]) and [[Girlguiding UK]].

[[File:The Earl and Countess of Wessex.JPG|thumb|The Earl and Countess of Wessex at [[Trooping the Colour]] in June 2013]]
The Earl and Countess of Wessex are the primary representatives of The Queen at foreign royal events, especially marriages of heirs apparent. In this capacity, the Countess has attended the weddings of the [[Haakon, Crown Prince of Norway|Crown Prince]] and [[Princess Martha Louise of Norway]], the [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Crown Prince of Denmark]], the [[Victoria, Crown Princess of Sweden|Crown Princess of Sweden]], the [[Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg]], the 40th birthday celebrations for the [[Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange|Prince of Orange]] (now King of the Netherlands) and the enthronement and the wedding of the [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince of Monaco]].

In December 2011, the Countess of Wessex joined her husband visiting troops in Afghanistan. On the same trip, the royal couple visited [[Bahrain]], and received two gifts of jewels from the Bahraini royal family and Prime Minister. Given concern about human rights abuses in Bahrain, this gift attracted controversy, with calls for the jewels to be sold, and the proceeds used for the benefit of the Bahraini people.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8999872/How-a-routine-royal-visit-spelt-trouble-for-the-Countess-of-Wessex.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Patrick | last=Sawer | title=How a routine royal visit spelt trouble for the Countess of Wessex | date=8 January 2012}}</ref> In February and March 2012, The Earl and Countess visited the Caribbean for the Diamond Jubilee, visiting [[Saint Lucia]], [[Barbados]], [[St Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Grenada]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Montserrat]], [[St Kitts and Nevis]], [[Anguilla]] and [[Antigua and Barbuda]]. Highlights of the tour included the 50th Anniversary Independence Day celebrations in Saint Lucia, a joint address from both houses of the Barbados Parliament and a visit to sites affected by the recent volcanic eruptions in Montserrat.<ref>{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Carolyn|title=Royals of the Caribbean: The 2012 Diamond Jubilee Commonwealth Tours Begin|url=http://www.royalhistorian.com/royals-of-the-caribbean-the-2012-diamond-jubilee-commonwealth-tours-begin/|accessdate=22 June 2013|publisher=royalhistorian.com|date=15 February 2012}}</ref>

==Criticism==
The Countess of Wessex has been criticised for accepting two sets of jewels from the [[Al Khalifa family|royal family]] of [[Bahrain]] during an official day-long<ref name="BBC 7.1.2012">{{cite news | author=[[Staff writer]] | title = Countess of Wessex's Bahrain jewel gift criticised | date=7 January 2012 | publisher=BBC | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16452634 | accessdate=9 January 2012}}</ref> visit to the country in December 2011, as she and her husband returned to the UK from a trip to [[Afghanistan]]. She was given one set by [[King of Bahrain|Bahrain’s king]] and a second set by the country’s prime minister, Sheikh [[Khalifa ibn Salman Al Khalifa]]. Her husband, the Earl, received a pen and a watch as well as a silk rug from the Crown Prince of Bahrain, Prince [[Salman bin Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa|Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa]], who also gave the countess a silver and pearl cup. The value of the jewellery has not been estimated and its precise contents were not disclosed.<ref name="Tele 6.1.2012">{{cite news | author=Andy Bloxham | title = Countess of Wessex criticised for accepting jewels from Bahrain | date=6 January 2012 | publisher=The Daily Telegraph | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8999280/Countess-of-Wessex-criticised-for-accepting-jewels-from-Bahrain.html | accessdate=9 January 2012 | location=London}}</ref>

Critics said the countess should sell the gems and give the proceeds to [[2011-2012 Bahraini uprising|political protesters]] in Bahrain. [[Denis MacShane]], a former Foreign Office minister, said: “Given the appalling suffering and repression of the Bahraini people, it would be a fitting gesture for the Countess of Wessex to auction these trinkets and distribute the proceeds to the victims of the regime.”<ref name="Tele 6.1.2012"/>

===Gift guidelines===
Royal Family guidelines and procedures relating to gifts drafted in 2003 state that "before accepting any gift, careful consideration should always be given, wherever practicable, to the donor, the reason for and occasion of the gift and the nature of the gift itself (..) Equally, before declining the offer of a gift, careful consideration should be given to any offence that might be caused by such action."<ref name="BBC 7.1.2012"/>
