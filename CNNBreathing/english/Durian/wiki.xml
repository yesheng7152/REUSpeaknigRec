Widely known and revered in [[Southeast Asia]] as the &quot;King of Fruits&quot;, the fruit is distinctive for its large size, unique [[odor|odour]], and formidable [[Spine (botany)|thorn]]-covered [[husk]]. The fruit can grow up to <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>30</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>cm</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>in</value></part></template> long and <template><title>convert</title><part><name index="1"/><value>15</value></part><part><name index="2"/><value>cm</value></part><part><name index="3"/><value>in</value></part><part><name index="4"/><value>0</value></part></template> in diameter, and typically weighs one to three&amp;nbsp;kilograms (2 to 7&amp;nbsp;lb). Its shape ranges from oblong to round, the colour of its husk green to brown, and its flesh pale-yellow to red, depending on the species.

The edible flesh emits a distinctive odour, strong and penetrating even when the husk is intact. Regarded by some as fragrant, others as overpowering and offensive, the smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust. The odour has led to the fruit's banishment from certain hotels and public transportation in Southeast Asia.

The durian, native to [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], has been known to the western world for about 600&amp;nbsp;years. The British [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] famously described its flesh as &quot;a rich custard highly flavoured with almonds&quot; in the 19th century. The flesh can be consumed at various stages of ripeness, and is used to flavour a wide variety of savoury and sweet edibles in Southeast Asian cuisines. The seeds can also be eaten when cooked. The name ''durian'' comes from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''duri'' (thorn) with [[suffix]] -''an''.

There are 30 recognised ''Durio'' species, at least nine of which produce edible fruit. ''Durio zibethinus'' is the only species available in the international market: other species are sold in their local regions. There are hundreds of durian [[cultivar]]s; most of them have a common name and a code number starting with &quot;D&quot;. Many consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.

Over the centuries, numerous durian [[cultivar]]s propagated by vegetative [[Cloning|clone]]s have arisen in southeast Asia. They used to be grown with mixed results from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit, but are now propagated by [[layering]], [[marcotting]], or more commonly, by [[grafting]], including bud, [[Wood veneer|veneer]], wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected [[rootstock]]s. Different cultivars can be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as the shape of the spines.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Brown</attr></ext> Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=ST</attr></ext>

[[Image:Singapore MRT Fines.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Sign forbidding durians on Singapore's [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]]]]

The unusual flavour and odour of the fruit have prompted many people to express diverse and passionate views ranging from deep appreciation to intense disgust. Writing in 1856, the British [[Natural history|naturalist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] provides a much-quoted description of the flavour of the durian:

<template lineStart="1"><title>cquote</title><part><name index="1"/><value> The five cells are silky-white within, and are filled with a mass of firm, cream-coloured pulp, containing about three seeds each. This pulp is the edible part, and its consistence and flavour are indescribable. A rich custard highly flavoured with almonds gives the best general idea of it, but there are occasional wafts of flavour that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine, and other incongruous dishes. Then there is a rich glutinous smoothness in the pulp which nothing else possesses, but which adds to its delicacy. It is neither acid nor sweet nor juicy; yet it wants neither of these qualities, for it is in itself perfect. It produces no nausea or other bad effect, and the more you eat of it the less you feel inclined to stop. In fact, to eat Durians is a new sensation worth a voyage to the East to experience. ... as producing a food of the most exquisite flavour it is unsurpassed.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Wallace</attr><inner>{{cite web | author = [[Alfred Russel Wallace|Wallace, Alfred Russel]] | title = On the Bamboo and Durian of Borneo | year = 1856 | url = http://www.wku.edu/~smithch/wallace/S027.htm | accessdate = 2008-11-20}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext></value></part></template>

The wide range of descriptions for the odour of durian may have a great deal to do with the variability of durian odour itself. Durians from different species or clones can have significantly different aromas; for example, red durian (''D. dulcis'') has a deep [[caramel]] flavour with a [[turpentine]] odour while red-fleshed durian (''D. graveolens'') emits a fragrance of roasted [[almond]]s.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=ACIAR2</attr><inner>{{cite web | url = http://www.cababstractsplus.org/google/abstract.asp?AcNo=20053008326| title = Occurrence, Distribution and Utilisation of Durian Germplasm | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2008-11-20 | format = PDF |author = O'Gara, E., Guest, D.

According to ''[[Larousse Gastronomique]]'', the durian fruit is ready to eat when its husk begins to crack.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book | title = [[Larousse Gastronomique]] | author = Montagne, Prosper (Ed.) | publisher = Clarkson Potter | year = 2001 | isbn = 0609609718 | pages = p. 439}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> However, the ideal stage of ripeness to be enjoyed varies from region to region in Southeast Asia and by species. Some species grow so tall that they can only be collected once they have fallen to the ground, whereas most cultivars of ''D. zibethinus'' are nearly always cut from the tree and allowed to ripen while waiting to be sold. Some people in [[southern Thailand]] prefer their durians relatively young when the clusters of fruit within the shell are still crisp in texture and mild in flavour. In [[northern Thailand]], the preference is for the fruit to be as soft and pungent in aroma as possible. In Malaysia and Singapore, most consumers prefer the fruit to be quite ripe and may even risk allowing the fruit to continue ripening after its husk has already cracked open. In this state, the flesh becomes richly creamy, slightly alcoholic,<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Davidson</attr></ext> the aroma pronounced and the flavour highly complex.

The various preferences regarding ripeness among consumers make it hard to issue general statements about choosing a &quot;good&quot; durian.

[[Image:Garcia-orta-coloquios.png|upright|left|thumb|''Colóquios dos Simples e Drogas da India'' (1563)]]

The durian has been known and consumed in southeastern Asia since [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]], but has only been known to the western world for about 600 years. The earliest known European reference to the durian is the record of [[Niccolò Da Conti]], who travelled to southeastern Asia in the 15th century.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Brown</attr></ext> The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] physician [[Garcia de Orta]] described durians in ''[[Colóquios dos Simples e Drogas da India]]'' published in 1563. In 1741, ''Herbarium Amboinense'' by the German botanist [[Georg Eberhard Rumphius]] was published, providing the most detailed and accurate account of durians for over a century. The genus ''Durio'' has a complex [[taxonomy]] that has seen the subtraction and addition of many species since it was created by Rumphius.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=ACIAR</attr></ext> During the early stages of its taxonomical study, there was some confusion between durian and the [[soursop]] (''Annona muricata''), for both of these species had thorny green fruit.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Brown</attr></ext> It is also interesting to note the Malay name for the soursop is ''durian Belanda'', meaning ''Dutch durian''.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite book | author=Davidson, Alan | title=The Oxford Companion to Food | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1999 | isbn = 0-19-211579-0 | pages= p. 737}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> In the 18th century, [[Johann Anton Weinmann]] considered the durian to belong to [[Chestnut|Castaneae]] as its fruit was similar to the horse chestnut.

''D. zibethinus'' was introduced into [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] by the Portuguese in the 16th century and was reintroduced many times later. It has been planted in the Americas but confined to [[botanical garden]]s.

In 1949, the British botanist [[E. J. H. Corner]] published ''The Durian Theory, or the Origin of the Modern Tree''. His theory was that [[Seed dispersal#Dispersal by animals|endozoochory]] (the enticement of animals to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any other method of [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], and that primitive ancestors of ''Durio'' species were the earliest practitioners of that dispersal method, in particular the red durian exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants.

Since the early 1990s, the domestic and international demand for durian in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ([[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]]) region has increased significantly, partly due to the increasing affluence in Asia.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=Brown</attr></ext>

The fruit was featured in the video game ''[[Madagascar (video game)|Madagascar]]'' where the main character battles the final boss that spews out debilitating durian breaths, with durians also used as projectile weapons.
