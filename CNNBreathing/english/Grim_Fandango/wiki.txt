'''''Grim Fandango''''' is a graphic [[adventure game|adventure]] [[Personal computer game|computer game]] released by [[LucasArts]] in {{vgy|1998}} and primarily written by [[Tim Schafer]]. It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional graphics]] overlayed on pre-rendered [[2D computer graphics|2D computer backgrounds]]. As with other [[LucasArts adventure games]], the player must converse with other characters and examine, collect, and use objects correctly to solve puzzles in the game in order to progress.

''Grim Fandango''{{'}}s world combines elements of [[Aztec]] beliefs of [[afterlife]] with style aspects of [[film noir]], including ''[[The Maltese Falcon]]'', ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', to create the Land of the Dead, which recently departed souls, represented in the game as ''[[calaca]]''-like figures, must travel through before they reach their final destination, the Ninth Underworld. The story follows travel agent Manuel "Manny" Calavera as he attempts to save Mercedes "Meche" Colomar, a newly arrived but virtuous soul, during her long journey.

The game received positive reviews, which praised its artistic design and overall game direction in particular. ''Grim Fandango'' was selected for several gaming awards at the time of release, and is often listed in publishers' lists of top games of all time. However, the game has been considered a commercial failure, which partially led LucasArts to terminate their adventure game development, contributing to the decline of the adventure game genre.

==Gameplay==
''Grim Fandango'' is an [[adventure game]], in which the player controls Manuel "Manny" Calavera as he follows Mercedes "Meche" Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the [[GrimE]] engine, rendering backgrounds in [[2D computer graphics|2D]], while the main objects and characters are represented in [[3D computer graphics|3D]]. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]], a [[joystick]] or a [[gamepad]]. Manny must collect objects that can be used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve [[puzzle]]s and progress in the game. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them, but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head towards that object or person as he walks by.<ref name="sfgate review"/> Manny can engage with other characters through [[conversation tree]]s to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot.<ref name="manual">{{cite book | title = Grim Fandango Instruction Manual | publisher = [[LucasArts]] | date = 1998 }}</ref> Like most other LucasArts adventure games, the player cannot ever get in a "dead-end" situation that would prevent progress forward due to the death of the character or other limitation.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-48.html | title = The Greatest Games of All Time: Day of the Tentacle | publisher =[[GameSpot]] | date = 2004-04-30 | accessdate = 2008-03-13 }}</ref>

===Setting===
''Grim Fandango'' takes place in the Land of the Dead, where recently departed souls make their way to the Ninth Underworld. For sinners, this is a four-year journey made on foot and many do not complete it, ending up taking jobs at way-points along the route. However, more virtuous souls receive assistance, the most virtuous getting passage on the "Number Nine" train ("Double N") that cuts the journey down to four minutes.<ref>{{cite video game|title = Grim Fandango | developer = LucasArts | date = 1997 | quote = '''Celso''': The Number Nine?<br/>'''Manny''': That's our top of the line express train. It shoots straight to the Ninth Underworld, the land of eternal rest in four minutes instead of four years.}}</ref> The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the [[Grim Reaper]] to escort the souls from the mortal world to Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year, on [[November 2]], there is a large festival celebration of the [[Day of the Dead]].<ref name="manual"/><ref name="Schafer design diary"/>

The souls in the Land of the Dead appear as skeletal ''calaca'' figures.<ref name="Schafer design diary"/>  Alongside them are demons that have been summoned to help with the more mundane tasks of day-to-day life, such as auto maintenance. The souls themselves can suffer death-within-death by being "sprouted", the result of being shot with "sproutella"-filled darts that cause flowers to grow out through the bones.<ref name="pcgamer preview"/> Many of the characters are [[Mexican]] and occasional [[Spanish language|Spanish]] words are interspersed into the [[English language|English]] dialog, resulting in [[Spanglish]].<ref name="sfgate review"/> Many of the characters smoke, which follows a film noir tradition.<ref name="manual"/>

===Story===
The game is divided into four acts, each taking place on [[November 2]] on four consecutive years.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/features/grim_gg/ | title = Grim Fandango Game Guide | publisher = [[GameSpot]] | first =  Wyatt | last = Shaker | accessdate = 2008-03-13}}</ref>  Manuel "Manny" Calavera is a travel agent at the Department of Death in El Marrow, forced into his job to work off a debt "to the powers that be".<ref>{{cite video game|title = Grim Fandango | developer = LucasArts | date = 1998 | quote = '''Manny''': Oh I can't leave here till I've worked off a little debt to the powers that be.}}</ref>  Manny is frustrated with being assigned clients that must take the four-year journey and is threatened to be fired by his boss, Don Copal, if he doesn't come up with better clients. Manny steals a client, Mercedes "Meche" Colomar, from his co-worker Domino Hurley. The Department computers assign Meche to the four-year journey even though Manny believes she should have a guaranteed spot on the "Number Nine" due to her pureness-of-heart in her life.<ref>{{cite video game|title = Grim Fandango | developer = LucasArts | date = 1998 | quote = '''Manny''': Meche. I can see it in your face. And in your file here, where it says you're entitled to a first-class ticket to...  ...nowhere?  WHAT?!<br/>'''Meche''': Did I do something wrong?<br/> '''Manny''': Not according to your bio! It was spotless!  ...at least the part I read was.}}</ref>  After setting Meche on her way, Manny investigates further and finds that Domino and Don have been rigging the system to deny many clients Double N tickets, hoarding them for the boss of the criminal underworld, Hector LeMans. He then sells them at an exorbitant price to those that can afford it. Manny recongizes that he cannot stop Hector presently and instead, with the help of his driver and speed demon Glottis, he tries to find Meche through her journey in the nearby Petrified Forest. During the trip Manny encounters Salvador "Sal" Limones, the leader of the small Lost Souls Alliance (LSA), who is aware of Hector's plans and recruits Manny to help.<ref>{{cite video game|title = Grim Fandango | developer = LucasArts | date = 1998 | quote = '''Salvador''': I was once a reaper like yourself Manuel, but I uncovered a web of corruption in our beloved Department of Death. I have reason to believe that the Bureau of Acquisitions is cheating the very souls it was charted to serve. I think someone is robbing these poor naive souls of their rightful destinies, leaving them no option but to march on a treacherous trail of tears, unprotected and alone, like babies, Manuel, like babies.}}</ref>  Manny arrives at the small port city of Rubacava and finds that he has beaten her there, and waits for her to show up.

A year passes, and the city of Rubacava has grown, Manny now running his own nightclub near the edge of the Forest. Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda that Don has been "sprouted" for letting the scandal be known and that Meche was recently seen with Domino leaving the port. Manny gives chase and a year later tracks them to the Edge of the World. Domino has been holding Meche there as a trap to lure Manny in order to get rid of both of them, all to keep Hector's scandal quiet.<ref>{{cite video game|title = Grim Fandango | developer = LucasArts | date = 1998 | quote = '''Meche''': You were headed for a trap, I was trying to warn you. Domino was using me like bait. I didn't want you to end up a prisoner here like me.}}</ref>  Manny defeats Domino and with Meche and Glottis escapes from the Edge of the World.

The three travel for another year until they reach the terminus for the Number Nine train before the Ninth Underworld. However, Glottis has fallen deathly ill. Manny learns from demons stationed at the terminus that the only way to revive Glottis is to travel at high speeds to restore Glottis' purpose for being summoned. Manny and the others devise a makeshift fuel source to create a "rocket" train cart, quickly taking Manny and Meche back to Rubacava and saving Glottis' life.<ref>{{cite video game|title = Grim Fandango | developer = LucasArts | date = 1998 | quote = '''Mechanics''': We shoot you now like an arrow into the wind. May you pierce the heart of the wind itself, and drink the blood of flight. Speed is the food of the great Glottis. Speed bring you life. Come back to us some day.}}</ref>  The three return to El Marrow, now found to be fully in Hector's control and renamed as Nuevo Marrow. Manny regroups with Sal and his expanded LSA and with the help of Olivia he is able to learn about Hector's current activities.<ref>{{cite video game|title = Grim Fandango | developer = LucasArts | date = 1998 | quote = '''Salvador''': So Manuel Calavera, we meet again. I am glad to see you have found what you were looking for. It is fortunate that you should arrive just now, as we, too, are about to achieve great success. Our army has grown, and right now our top agents are in Hector's weapon lab, about to close in on the enemy in his own den. I couldn't have done it without you, Manuel.}}</ref>  Further investigation reveals that Hector not only has been hording the Number Nine tickets, but has created counterfeit versions that he has sold to others.<ref>{{cite video game|title = Grim Fandango | developer = LucasArts | date = 1998 | quote = '''Meche''': It's all the Double-N tickets Hector and Dom have stolen over the years. Each one stolen from a good soul, and now they just...  ...sit there.<br/>'''Manny''': That's it<br/> '''Meche''': What?<br/> '''Manny''': They just sit there! That's what's been bothering me!  In the days when I was a hot salesman, I used to see Double-N tickets all the time...  ...and they move!<br/> '''Meche''': What do you mean, they move?<br/> '''Manny''': They become agitated around human souls, and the ticket that belongs to you will actually fly into your hand. But these tickets, and the tickets in that suitcase of Charlie's, it's like they're...  ...dead. Why would Hector and Domino be hoarding cases of counterfeit Double-N tickets? }}</ref>  Manny tries to confront Hector but is lured into another trap by Olivia, who has also captured Sal, and is taken to Hector's greenhouse to be sprouted. Manny is able to defeat Hector after Sal sacrifices himself to prevent Olivia from interfering. Manny and Meche are able to find the real Double N tickets, including the one that Meche should have received. Manny makes sure the rest of the tickets are given to their rightful owners; in turn, he is granted his own for his good deeds.<ref>{{cite video game|title = Grim Fandango | developer = LucasArts | date = 1998 | quote = '''Meche''': You can count them if you want. They're all here. <br/> '''Gate Keeper''': What about yours? <br/> '''Manny''': The company gave me one on the other end; sort of a retirement present.}}</ref>  Together, Manny and Meche board the Number Nine for their happy journey to the Ninth Underworld.

==Development==
''Grim Fandango'' was designed by [[Tim Schafer]], co-designer of ''[[Day of the Tentacle]]'' and creator of ''[[Full Throttle (1995 video game)|Full Throttle]]'' and the more recent ''[[Psychonauts]]''. Schafer had begun work on the game soon after completing ''Full Throttle'' in mid-{{vgy|1995}}.<ref name="pcgamer preview"/> ''Grim Fandango'' was an attempt by LucasArts to rejuvenate the graphic adventure genre, in decline by 1998.<ref name="gamasutra lifecycle">{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20070515/cook_01.shtml | title = The Circle of Life: An Analysis of the Game Product Lifecycle  | first = Daniel | last = Cook | date = 2007-05-07 | accessdate = 2008-03-03 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]]}}</ref><ref name="salon future of gaming"/> It was the first LucasArts adventure since ''[[Labyrinth (game)|Labyrinth]]'' not to use the [[SCUMM]] engine, instead using the [[Sith (engine)|Sith]] engine, pioneered by ''[[Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II]]'', as the basis of the new [[GrimE]] engine.<ref>{{cite web | first = Bret | last = Mogilefsky | url = http://www.grimfandango.net/?page=articles&pagenumber=2 | title = Lua in Grim Fandango | publisher = Grim Fandango Network | accessdate = 2008-03-06 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url  =http://www.gamasutra.com/features/19990813/droidworks_01.htm | title = Postmortem: LucasLearning's Star Wars DroidWorks | date = 1999-08-13 | author = Blossom, Jon and Michaud, Collette | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] | accessdate = 2008-03-17}}</ref>  The GrimE engine was built using the scripting language [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], in part due to LucasArts programmer Bret Mogilefsky, and is considered to be one of the first applications of the language in gaming applications.<ref name="lua gf"/> The game's success led to the language's use in many other games and applications, including ''[[Escape from Monkey Island]]'' and ''[[Baldur's Gate]]''.<ref name="lua gf">{{cite conference | first = Roberto | last = Ierusalimschy | coauthors = de Figueiredo, Luiz Henrique and Celes, Waldemar | title =The Evolution of an Extension Language: A History of Lua | booktitle =  Proceedings of V Brazilian Symposium on Programming Languages | date = 2001 | pages = B-14&ndash;B-28 | url = http://www.lua.org/history.html | accessdate = 2008-03-17}}</ref>

''Grim Fandango'' mixed static [[pre-rendered]] background images with 3D characters and objects. Part of this decision was based on how the ''calaca'' figures would appear in three dimensions.<ref name="pcgamer preview">{{cite news | title = The Everlasting Adventure | publisher = ''[[PC Gamer]]'' | date = May 1998 | first = Chris | last = Buxton | accessdate = 2008-03-15 | pages = 48–52}}</ref>  There were more than 90 sets and 50 characters in the game to be created and rendered; Manny's character alone comprised 250 [[polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]]s.<ref name="pcgamer preview"/>  The development team found that by utilizing three-dimensional models to pre-render the backgrounds, they could alter the camera shot to achieve more effective or dramatic angles for certain scenes simply by re-rendering the background, instead of having to have an artist redraw the background for a traditional 2D adventure game.<ref name="pcgamer preview"/>  The team adapted the engine to allow Manny's head to move separately from his body to make the player aware of important objects nearby.<ref name="pcgamer preview"/>  The 3D engine also aided in the choreography between the spoken dialog and body and arm movements of the characters.<ref name="pcgamer preview"/>  Additionally, [[full-motion video]] [[cutscene]]s were incorporated to advance the plot, using the same in-game style for the characters and backgrounds to make them nearly indistinguishable from the actual game.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://gamasutra.com/features/20000103/fmv_01.htm | title = Video in Games: The State of the Industry | date = 2000-01-03 | accessdate =2008-03-13 | author =Waggoner, Ben and York, Halstead | publisher = [[Gamasutra]]}}</ref>  

The game combines several [[Aztec]] beliefs of the afterlife and underworld with 1930s [[Art Deco]] design motifs and a dark plot reminiscent of the [[film noir]] genre.<ref name="Schaferinterview">{{cite web | first=Celia | last = Pearce | date=2003-03-07 | title= Game Noir - A Conversation with Tim Schafer| url=http://www.gamestudies.org/0301/pearce/ | publisher=International Journal of Computer Game Research | accessdate=2008-03-06}}</ref> The Aztec motifs of the game were influenced by Schafer's decade-long fascination with [[folklore]] and talks with forklorist [[Alan Dundes]], with Schafer recognizing that the four-year journey of the soul in the afterlife would set the stage for an adventure game.<ref name="sfgate review"/>  Schafer stated that once he had set on the Afterlife setting: "Then I thought, what role would a person want to play in a Day of the Dead scenario? You'd want to be the grim reaper himself. That's how Manny got his job. Then I imagined him picking up people in the land of the living and bringing them to the land of the dead, like he's really just a glorified limo or taxi driver. So the idea came of Manny having this really mundane job that looks glamorous because he has the robe and the scythe, but really, he's just punching the clock."<ref name="sfgate review"/>  The division of the game into four years was a way of breaking the game's overall puzzle into four discrete sections.<ref name="pcgamer preview"/><ref name="sfgate review"/>

Several film noir movies were inspiration for much of the game's plot and characters. Tim Schafer stated that the true inspiration was drawn from films like ''[[Double Indemnity (film)|Double Indemnity]]'', in which a weak and undistinguished insurance salesman finds himself entangled in a murder plot.<ref name="Schaferinterview"/> The design and early plot are fashioned after films such as ''[[Chinatown (film)|Chinatown]]'' and ''[[Glengarry Glen Ross (film)|Glengarry Glen Ross]]''.<ref name="Schafer design diary">{{cite web | first=Tim | last= Schafer | year=1997 | title =Grim Fandango Design Diaries| url=http://www.gamespot.com/features/fandango_dd/110597/110597_3.html | publisher=[[GameSpot]]| accessdate=2007-09-25}}</ref><ref name="sfgate review"/>  Several scenes in ''Grim Fandango'' are directly inspired by the genre's films such as ''The Maltese Falcon'', ''[[The Third Man]]'', ''[[Key Largo (film)|Key Largo]]'', and most notably ''Casablanca'': two characters in the game's second act are directly modeled after the roles played by [[Peter Lorre]] and [[Claude Rains]] in the film.<ref name="Schaferinterview"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1997_Sept_8/ai_19726667 | title = LucasArts' Grim Fandango Presents a Surreal Tale of Crime, Corruption and Greed in the Land of the Dead; Dramatic New Graphic Adventure from the Creator of Award-Winning Full Throttle Expected to Release in First Half 1998 | publisher = Business Wire | date = 1997-09-08 | accessdate = 2007-12-02 }}</ref>  The main villain, Hector LeMans, was designed to resemble [[Sydney Greenstreet]]'s character of Signor Ferrari from ''Casablanca''.<ref name="sfgate review"/> 

Visually, the game drew inspiration from various sources: the skeletal character designs were based largely on the ''calaca'' figures used in Mexican Day of the Dead festivities, while the architecture ranged from Art Deco skyscrapers to an Aztec temple.<ref name="Schaferinterview"/> The team turned to LucasArts artist Peter Chan to create the ''calaca'' figures, while [[Ed Roth|Ed "Big Daddy" Roth]] was used for the designs of the [[hot rod]]s and the demon characters like Glottis.<ref name="sfgate review">{{cite news | publisher = San Franscico Chronicle | date = 1998-10-27 | first = Laura | last = Evenson | title = Fleshing Out an Idea | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/1998/10/27/DD89817.DTL&type=printable | accessdate= 2008-03-15}}</ref>   

The game featured a large cast for voice acting in game's dialog and cutscenes, employing many [[Latino]] actors to help with the Spanish slang.<ref name="sfgate review"/>  Voice actors included [[Tony Plana]] as Manny, [[Maria Canals]] as Meche, [[Alan Blumenfeld]] as Glottis, and [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]] as Hector. The game's music, a mix of an orchestral score, South American folk music, jazz, swing and big band sounds, was composed at LucasArts by [[Peter McConnell]] and inspired by the likes of [[Duke Ellington]] and [[Benny Goodman]] as well as film composers [[Max Steiner]] and [[Adolph Deutsch]].<ref name="mcconnell music"/>  The score featured live musicians that McConnell knew or made contact with in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s [[Mission District]], including a [[mariachi]] band.<ref name="mcconnell music">{{cite web| url=http://www.lucasarts.com/products/grim/grim_files.htm| title=Grim Fandango Files| publisher=[[LucasArts]]| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070214102114/http://www.lucasarts.com/products/grim/grim_files.htm| archivedate=2007-02-14| accessdate=2007-09-17}}</ref>  The soundtrack was released as a [[compact disc|CD]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/Grim-Fandango-Soundtrack-Peter-McConnell/dp/B000J5N2OC/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1206130701&sr=8-12 | title = Grim Fandango Soundtrack | publisher = [[Amazon.com]] | accessdate = 2008-03-21}}</ref>

Originally, the game was to be shipped in the first half of {{vgy|1998}} but was delayed;<ref name="pcgamer preview"/> as a result, the game was released on the Friday before [[November 2]], [[1998]], a few days before the actual Day of the Dead celebration.<ref name="sfgate review"/> Tim Schafer left LucasArts shortly after ''Grim Fandango''{{'}}s release, and created his own company, [[Double Fine Productions]], in {{vgy|2000}} along with many of those involved in the development of ''Grim Fandango''.

Schafer has stated that while there is strong interest from fans and that he "would love to go back and spend time with the characters from any game <nowiki>[</nowiki>he{{'}}s<nowiki>]</nowiki> worked on", a sequel to ''Grim Fandango'' or his other previous games is unlikely as "I also want to make something new."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.playboy.com/magazine/features/video-game-blowout/video-game-blowout1.html | title = Geniuses at Play | publisher = [[Playboy]] | accessdate = 2008-03-05 | date = 2008 }}</ref>

''Grim Fandango'' sales were poor despite the positive reception given to the game. Initial estimates suggested that the game sold well during the {{vgy|1998}} holiday season.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.smartmoney.com/email/index.cfm?emailcontent=/consumer/index.cfm?story=199812082 | title = Tech Gifts of the Season | first= Joshua | last = Albertson | publisher = Smart Money | date = 1998-12-08 | accessdate = 2008-03-15 }}</ref>   However, the game only sold about 95,000 copies up through 2003 in North America, excluding online sales, based on data provided by PC Data (now owned by [[NPD Group]]).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.justadventure.com/articles/Not_Playing/Part_4.shtm | title = (Not) Playing the Game, Part 4 | first = Randy | last = Sluganski | publisher = Just Adventure | accessdate = 2007-12-02 }}</ref>  Total cumulative worldwide sales are estimated between 100,000 and 500,000 units.<ref name="escapist 10 years"/>  The game is commonly considered a "commercial failure",<ref>{{cite web | url = http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/01/04/y2k.game.idg/index.html | title = Y2K the game, appropriately enough, is a dud | publisher = [[CNN]] | accessdate = 2008-03-13 | date = 2000-01-04 | first = Barry | last = Brenasal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gameology.org/node/636 | title = Review: LucasArts' Grim Fandango (1998) | first = Matt | last = Barton | publisher = Gameology | date = 2005-11-05 | accessdate = 2008-03-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =  http://retro.ign.com/articles/856/856379p1.html | title = The Lives and Deaths of the Interactive Movie | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = 2008-03-03 | accessdate = 2008-03-06 | first = Travis | last = Fahs}}</ref> even though LucasArts has stated that "Grim Fandango met domestic expectations and exceeded them worldwide".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamer.nl/doc/5468 | title = "Lucasarts ziet het licht" | language = Dutch | first = Bob | last = Christof | publisher = Gamer.nl | date = 2000-06-26 | accessdate = 2007-12-02 | language = English/Dutch }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://web.archive.org/web/20010627012617/http://www.dailyradar.com/news/game_news_3201.html | title = "The Future Of LucasArts" | language = English | publisher = Daily Radar | date = 2000-05-25 | accessdate = 2008-03-19}} "Although LucasArts, a privately held company, will not release sales figures, a spokesperson expressed confidence in the history and future of LucasArt's original titles.
