'''''Grim Fandango''''' is a graphic [[adventure game|adventure]] [[Personal computer game|computer game]] released by [[LucasArts]] in <template><title>vgy</title><part><name index="1"/><value>1998</value></part></template> and primarily written by [[Tim Schafer]]. It is the first adventure game by LucasArts to use [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional graphics]] overlayed on pre-rendered [[2D computer graphics|2D computer backgrounds]]. As with other [[LucasArts adventure games]], the player must converse with other characters and examine, collect, and use objects correctly to solve puzzles in the game in order to progress.

''Grim Fandango''<template><title>'</title></template>s world combines elements of [[Aztec]] beliefs of [[afterlife]] with style aspects of [[film noir]], including ''[[The Maltese Falcon]]'', ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' and ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', to create the Land of the Dead, which recently departed souls, represented in the game as ''[[calaca]]''-like figures, must travel through before they reach their final destination, the Ninth Underworld. The story follows travel agent Manuel &quot;Manny&quot; Calavera as he attempts to save Mercedes &quot;Meche&quot; Colomar, a newly arrived but virtuous soul, during her long journey.

The game received positive reviews, which praised its artistic design and overall game direction in particular. ''Grim Fandango'' was selected for several gaming awards at the time of release, and is often listed in publishers' lists of top games of all time. However, the game has been considered a commercial failure, which partially led LucasArts to terminate their adventure game development, contributing to the decline of the adventure game genre.

<h level="2" i="1">==Gameplay==</h>
''Grim Fandango'' is an [[adventure game]], in which the player controls Manuel &quot;Manny&quot; Calavera as he follows Mercedes &quot;Meche&quot; Colomar in the Underworld. The game uses the [[GrimE]] engine, rendering backgrounds in [[2D computer graphics|2D]], while the main objects and characters are represented in [[3D computer graphics|3D]]. The player controls Manny's movements and actions with a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]], a [[joystick]] or a [[gamepad]]. Manny must collect objects that can be used with either other collectible objects, parts of the scenery or with other people in the Land of the Dead in order to solve [[puzzle]]s and progress in the game. Unlike the earlier 2D LucasArts games, the player is informed of objects or persons of interest not by text floating on the screen when the player passes a cursor over them, but instead by the fact that Manny will turn his head towards that object or person as he walks by.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;sfgate review&quot;</attr></ext> Manny can engage with other characters through [[conversation tree]]s to gain hints of what needs to be done to solve the puzzles or to progress the plot.<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;manual&quot;</attr><inner>{{cite book | title = Grim Fandango Instruction Manual | publisher = [[LucasArts]] | date = 1998 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> Like most other LucasArts adventure games, the player cannot ever get in a &quot;dead-end&quot; situation that would prevent progress forward due to the death of the character or other limitation.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/p-48.html | title = The Greatest Games of All Time: Day of the Tentacle | publisher =[[GameSpot]] | date = 2004-04-30 | accessdate = 2008-03-13 }}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>

<h level="3" i="3">===Setting===</h>
''Grim Fandango'' takes place in the Land of the Dead, where recently departed souls make their way to the Ninth Underworld. For sinners, this is a four-year journey made on foot and many do not complete it, ending up taking jobs at way-points along the route. However, more virtuous souls receive assistance, the most virtuous getting passage on the &quot;Number Nine&quot; train (&quot;Double N&quot;) that cuts the journey down to four minutes.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite video game|title = Grim Fandango | developer = LucasArts | date = 1997 | quote = '''Celso''': The Number Nine?&lt;br/&gt;'''Manny''': That's our top of the line express train. It shoots straight to the Ninth Underworld, the land of eternal rest in four minutes instead of four years.}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext> The travel agents of the Department of Death act as the [[Grim Reaper]] to escort the souls from the mortal world to Land of the Dead, and then determine which mode of transport the soul has merited. Each year, on [[November 2]], there is a large festival celebration of the [[Day of the Dead]].<ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;manual&quot;</attr></ext><ext><name>ref</name><attr> name=&quot;Schafer design diary&quot;</attr></ext>

Manny steals a client, Mercedes &quot;Meche&quot; Colomar, from his co-worker Domino Hurley. The Department computers assign Meche to the four-year journey even though Manny believes she should have a guaranteed spot on the &quot;Number Nine&quot; due to her pureness-of-heart in her life.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite video game|title = Grim Fandango | developer = LucasArts | date = 1998 | quote = '''Manny''': Meche.

It was spotless!  ...at least the part I read was.}}</inner><close>&lt;/ref&gt;</close></ext>  After setting Meche on her way, Manny investigates further and finds that Domino and Don have been rigging the system to deny many clients Double N tickets, hoarding them for the boss of the criminal underworld, Hector LeMans. He then sells them at an exorbitant price to those that can afford it. Manny recongizes that he cannot stop Hector presently and instead, with the help of his driver and speed demon Glottis, he tries to find Meche through her journey in the nearby Petrified Forest. During the trip Manny encounters Salvador &quot;Sal&quot; Limones, the leader of the small Lost Souls Alliance (LSA), who is aware of Hector's plans and recruits Manny to help.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite video game|title = Grim Fandango | developer = LucasArts | date = 1998 | quote = '''Salvador''': I was once a reaper like yourself Manuel, but I uncovered a web of corruption in our beloved Department of Death.

A year passes, and the city of Rubacava has grown, Manny now running his own nightclub near the edge of the Forest. Manny learns from Olivia Ofrenda that Don has been &quot;sprouted&quot; for letting the scandal be known and that Meche was recently seen with Domino leaving the port. Manny gives chase and a year later tracks them to the Edge of the World. Domino has been holding Meche there as a trap to lure Manny in order to get rid of both of them, all to keep Hector's scandal quiet.<ext><name>ref</name><attr/><inner>{{cite video game|title = Grim Fandango | developer = LucasArts | date = 1998 | quote = '''Meche''': You were headed for a trap, I was trying to warn you.

The three travel for another year until they reach the terminus for the Number Nine train before the Ninth Underworld. However, Glottis has fallen deathly ill. Manny learns from demons stationed at the terminus that the only way to revive Glottis is to travel at high speeds to restore Glottis' purpose for being summoned.

Manny is able to defeat Hector after Sal sacrifices himself to prevent Olivia from interfering. Manny and Meche are able to find the real Double N tickets, including the one that Meche should have received.
