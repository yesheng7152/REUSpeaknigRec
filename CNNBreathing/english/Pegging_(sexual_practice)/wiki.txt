'''Pegging''' is a sexual practice in which a woman penetrates a man's anus with a [[strap-on dildo]]. The [[neologism]] "pegging" was popularized when it became the winning entry in a contest in [[Dan Savage]]'s ''[[Savage Love]]'' sex advice column, held after an observation was made that there was no common name for the act.<ref name=sl>These three links chronicle how the term ''pegging'' came into usage.

==Pleasurable aspects==
===Physical pleasure===
{{Main|Strap-on dildo}}
In terms of physical pleasure, women may get direct stimulation from the base of the dildo, or in the case of a [[double-ended dildo]], from vaginal penetration.  A woman can use a secondary [[Vibrator (sensual)|vibrator]], between the dildo and her [[clitoris]], to get pleasure from pegging. Men may find stimulation of the anus, rectum, and adjacent organs, and particularly the [[prostate]], enjoyable, which can lead to an [[anal orgasm]].  Some men enjoy [[masturbation|masturbating]] (or being manually stimulated) during pegging.

===Psychological pleasure===
Some people who engage in pegging may find pleasure in the psychological aspects of [[domination and submission]] which can be evoked through the practice. In particular, it is quite common for a [[femdom]] roleplay to culminate in a pegging. Given the stigma associated with anal sex (and its association with male homosexuality), some people, many of them [[heterosexual]], derive enjoyment from the associated [[taboo]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Advice columnist Dan Savage wrote that he believes all men should try pegging at least once, as it may introduce them to a new enjoyable sexual activity and illuminate them to the receiver's perspective in sex.<ref name=sl/> A man may [[cross-dress]] in feminine [[lingerie]] such as [[stockings]], [[garters]] and high heeled shoes. This completion of the role reversal can be deeply erotic for some. Some people, particularly [[genderqueer]] people or those who engage in [[genderfuck]] may enjoy the [[gender]]-transgressive aspects of pegging. Some females may enjoy the feeling of having a "simulated penis".

==Instructional materials==
A few instructional movies and books have emerged in recent years, including ''[[Bend Over Boyfriend]]'', produced by Fatale Media, Inc., and directed by Shar Rednour, SIR Video co-founder.

The American pornographic film director and sex educator [[Tristan Taormino]] released an instructional pegging movie in 2009 by [[Vivid Entertainment]] Studio, ''Tristan Taormino's Expert Guide to Anal Pleasure for Men'',<ref>{{cite journal | title=A Comparison of Male and Female Directors in Popular Pornography | first1=Chyng | last1=Sun | first2=Ana | last2=Bridges | first3=Robert | last3=Wosnitzer | first4=Erica | last4=Scharrer | first5=Rachael | last5=Liberman | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2008.00439.x/full | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2008.00439.x | journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume=32 | issue=3 | pages=312–325 | month=September | year=2008 }}</ref> featuring a detailed explanation about male anal pleasure and strap-on dildo sex. In it, she teaches a workshop with instructions and skills for safe and pleasurable female on male anal sex. There are three scenes, in which pairs of pornographic actors explore different sexual devices and positions for pegging.

As an accomplished author of numerous sex guides and informational books on various sexual taboos, [[Violet Blue (author)|Violet Blue]] wrote and released ''The Adventurous Couple's Guide to Strap-On Sex'' in 2007.

==Pegging in pornography==
Pegging has recently been featured in a number of [[pornographic movie]]s; the first pegging scene (long before the term was developed) appears to have been in the non-pornographic 1970 film ''[[Myra Breckinridge (film)|Myra Breckinridge]]'', based on the novel of the same name by [[Gore Vidal]], although it was not explicit. The first explicit such scene is believed to have occurred in the 1975 pornographic film ''[[The Opening of Misty Beethoven]]''.<ref name=nault>{{cite journal | journal=[[Jump Cut (journal)|Jump Cut]] | number=52 | date=summer 2010 | title=Bend Over Boyfriend to Take it Like a Man: pegging pornography and the queer representation of straight sex | first=Curran | last=Nault | url=http://www.ejumpcut.org/currentissue/naultPegging/text.html }}</ref>

In the 21st century, female-to-male strap-on pornography has suddenly become a flourishing industry in the U.S., with such a high market value that a number of studios have started producing dedicated series about it. The most notable titles are ''Strap It On'' (black women on white men), ''Babes Balling Boys'', which currently has sixteen editions, ''Strap Attack'', ''Strap-on Sirenz'', ''Strap-on Chicks'', ''Boss Bitches'', which currently has over two dozen editions, various movies produced by LEDA Studios, and San Francisco-based ''Men In Pain''. It is unclear what triggered the increasing popularity of this genre, but there are now several hundred exclusively pegging titles, as well as twice as many [[bisexual]] and straight films with strap-on scenes. Well-known female [[porn stars]] who have professed an enjoyment of pegging their male partners include [[Taylor Wane]], [[Brittany Andrews]], and [[Monique Covét]]. When questioned about her particular [[kink (sexual)|kink]] Covét replied, "If we women have to take it from behind, then why not a man?"<ref>http://www.budapestsun.com/news/54577</ref>
