==History==
Ivy Creek flows through this area of western Albemarle County. It was cited in deeds for land in the Ivy area as early as the 1750s. The village at the present location of Ivy was known as Woodville (for the locally prominent Wood family) between 1826 and 1851. After the arrival of the railroad in 1851, the rail stop at this location was known as Woodville Depot. By 1859, the name had changed to Ivy Depot, probably after Ivy Creek. The village's name was shortened to Ivy in the 1950s.<ref>[http://albemarle.org/upload/images/Forms_Center/Departments/Community_Development/Forms/Historic_Preservation/AB-066_AH_Village_Survey_1995_D&M_report_final.pdf "Historic Architectural Survey of Albemarle County Villages"]</ref>
