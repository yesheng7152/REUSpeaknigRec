==Etymology==
[[Image:Bukkake_udon_tent.jpg |thumb|right|In Japanese, the word ''bukkake'' has extensive non-sexual use, such as this food tent advertising ''bukkake udon'' noodles.]]
Bukkake is the noun form of the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] verb ''bukkakeru'' (ぶっ掛ける, to dash or splash water),<ref>[http://www.seekjapan.jp/article-1/744/The+(Almost)+Complete+Japanzine+Dictionary+of+Japan+Sex Dictionary of Japan Sex]</ref> and means "to dash," "splash" or "heavy splash."<ref name=Routledge/><ref name=Fantabulosa>{{cite book|title=Fantabulosa: a dictionary of Polari and gay slang|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|author=Paul Baker |year=2004|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T72TJfZoywAC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|isbn=0826473431|page=90}}</ref> The compound verb can be decomposed into two verbs: ''butsu'' (ぶつ) and ''kakeru'' (掛ける). ''Butsu'' literally means to hit, but in this usage it appears to be an verb-intensifer prefix. Other examples of this usage include ''buttamageru'' (ぶったまげる, "completely astonished") and  ''butchigiri'' (ぶっちぎり, "overwhelming win"). 

''Kakeru'' in this context means to shower or pour. The word ''bukkake'' is often used in Japanese to describe pouring out water with sufficient momentum to cause splashing or spilling.  Indeed, bukkake is used in Japan to describe a type of dish where the broth is poured on top of noodles, as in bukkake-[[udon]] and bukkake-[[soba]].

==History==
Bukkake was first represented in [[pornographic films]] in the mid to late 1980s in Japan.<ref name=Fantabulosa/><ref name=cake/> A significant factor in the development of bukkake as a pornographic form was the mandatory censorship of genitalia in Japan.<ref name=wired/> Genitals must be [[Pixelization|pixelated]] by a "mosaic."<ref name=wired/> One consequence of this is that Japanese pornography tends to focus more on the face and body of actresses, rather than their genitals.<ref name=wired/> Since film producers could not show penetration, they sought other ways to depict sex acts without violating Japanese law.<ref name=wired/> Semen was not required to be censored, thus creating a loophole for harder sex scenes.<ref name=wired/> The first known recorded and publicly released act of ''bukkake'' in [[Japanese pornography]] was in the movie {{nihongo|''Mascot Note''|マスカットノート}} starring Matsuoka Aiko, released in December 1986, the act being previously known simply as {{nihongo|''gansha''|顔射|"facial ejaculation"}}, which term does not denote multiple men ejaculating on one woman's face.  However, popularization of the act and the term for it has been credited to director [[Kazuhiko Matsumoto]] in 1998.<ref name=wired>{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2004/04/63009?currentPage=2 |title=Fix for Japan Pop-Culture Addicts |accessdate=2009-07-01 |author=Xeni Jardin |date=2004-12-04 |work= |publisher=[[Wired (magazine)|wired.com]]}}</ref> The practice then spread from Japan to American and then European pornography after US porn producers discovered Japanese bukkake videos in the late 1990s.<ref name=cake/><ref name=americanbukkake>pp.31-37 ''My, My American Bukkake'' by Susannah Breslin in Greta Christina, Daniel Clowes, ''Best Erotic Comics 2008, illustrated edition'', Last Gasp, 2007.

The practice then spread to [[gay pornography]], in which several men ejaculate on another man.<ref name=Fantabulosa/><ref name=cake/> Pornographic use of the word has been expanded by the ''[[lesbian bukkake]]'' series, in which several women purportedly [[Female ejaculation|ejaculate]] on another woman.<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Ashley Blue]] (Director) | title = Lesbian Bukkake | medium = [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] | publisher = JM Productions |accessdate=2007-04-20 |date=  2004 |url=http://www.iafd.com/title.asp?title=Lesbian+Bukkake+1&year=2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Sargeant |first=Jack |authorlink=Jack Sargeant |year=2006 |month=November |volume=9 |issue=5 |title=Filth and Sexual Excess: Some Brief Reflections on Popular Scatology |journal=Media and Culture Journal |url=http://www.journal.media-culture.org.au/0610/03-sargeant.php |accessdate=2007-04-19}}</ref>

The 17th World Congress of [[Sexology]] in Montreal in July 2005 included a presentation on bukkake.<ref name=cake/>

==Criticism==
Some people have described bukkake as a [[sexual fetishism|fetish]] culture "beyond sex." Others describe bukkake as symbolic [[group rape]], with its primary purpose as the humiliation, degradation and [[Sexual objectification|objectification of women]],<ref>{{cite journal
