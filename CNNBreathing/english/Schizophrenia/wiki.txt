<!--Para1: Definition, symptoms and diagnosis-->
'''Schizophrenia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|k|ɪ|t|s|ɵ|ˈ|f|r|ɛ|n|i|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|k|ɪ|t|s|ɵ|ˈ|f|r|iː|n|i|ə}}) is a [[mental disorder]] often characterized by abnormal social behavior and failure to recognize what is [[reality|real]]. Common symptoms include [[Delusion|false beliefs]], [[thought disorder|unclear or confused thinking]], [[auditory hallucination]]s, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and [[Avolition|inactivity]]. Diagnosis is based on observed behavior and the person's reported experiences.

<!--Para2:Cause-->
[[Genetics]] and early environment, as well as [[Psychology|psychological]] and social processes, appear to be important contributory factors. Some recreational and prescription drugs appear to cause or worsen symptoms. The many possible combinations of symptoms have triggered debate about whether the diagnosis represents a single disorder or a number of separate syndromes. Despite the [[etymology|origin]] of the term from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots ''skhizein'' ("to split") and ''phrēn'' ("mind"), schizophrenia does not imply a "split personality", or "[[dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]]"—a condition with which it is often confused in public perception.<ref name=BMJ07/> Rather, the term means a "splitting of mental functions", reflecting the presentation of the illness.<ref>{{cite book |author= Baucum, Don |title= Psychology |year= 2006 |publisher= Barron's |location=Hauppauge, N.Y. |isbn=9780764134210|page=182|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=iCVSdYdA36EC&pg=PA182|edition=2nd}}</ref>

<!--Para3: Treatment-->
The mainstay of treatment is [[antipsychotic]] medication, which primarily suppresses [[dopamine]] [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] activity. [[Psychotherapy|Counseling]], job training and social rehabilitation are also important in treatment. In more serious cases—where there is risk to self or others—[[emergency psychiatry|involuntary hospitalization]] may be necessary, although hospital stays are now shorter and less frequent than they once were.<ref name="BeckerKilian2006">{{cite journal |author=Becker T, Kilian R|year=2006 |title=Psychiatric services for people with severe mental illness across western Europe: what can be generalized from current knowledge about differences in provision, costs and outcomes of mental health care? |journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] Supplement |volume=113 |pages=9–16 |pmid=16445476 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2005.00711.x |issue=429}}</ref>

<!--Para4: Epidemiology and prognosis-->
Symptoms begin typically in young adulthood, and about 0.3–0.7% of people are affected during their lifetime.<ref name=Lancet09/> The disorder is thought to mainly affect the ability to [[cognition|think]], but it also usually contributes to chronic problems with behavior and emotion. People with schizophrenia are likely to have additional conditions, including [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] and [[anxiety disorder]]s; the lifetime occurrence of [[substance use disorder]] is almost 50%.<ref name="Sim_et_al_2006">{{cite journal |author=Buckley PF, Miller BJ, Lehrer DS, Castle DJ |title=Psychiatric comorbidities and schizophrenia |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=383–402 |date=March 2009  |pmid=19011234 |pmc=2659306 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbn135}}</ref> Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty, and homelessness are common. The average [[life expectancy]] of people with the disorder is ten to twenty five years less than the average life expectancy.<ref name=Lauren2012/> This is the result of increased physical health problems and a higher [[suicide]] rate (about 5%).<ref name=Lancet09/><ref name=Jop2010>{{cite journal|author=Hor K, Taylor M|title=Suicide and schizophrenia: a systematic review of rates and risk factors |journal=Journal of psychopharmacology (Oxford, England)|date=November 2010|volume=24|issue=4 Suppl|pages=81–90|pmid=20923923|doi=10.1177/1359786810385490}}</ref>

Individuals with schizophrenia may experience [[hallucination]]s (most reported are [[Auditory hallucination|hearing voices]]), [[delusion]]s (often bizarre or [[Persecutory delusions|persecutory]] in nature), and [[Thought disorder|disorganized thinking and speech]]. The last may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to speech that is not understandable known as [[Schizophasia|word salad]] in severe cases. Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss of motivation and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.<ref name=CarsonNursing>Carson VB (2000).

Schizophrenia is often described in terms of [[Symptom#Positive and negative|positive and negative (or deficit) symptoms]].<ref name="Sims_2002">{{cite book |author=Sims A |title=Symptoms in the mind: an introduction to descriptive psychopathology |publisher=W. B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2002 |isbn=0-7020-2627-1 }}</ref> Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and [[tactile]], [[Auditory hallucination|auditory]], [[visual]], [[olfactory]] and [[gustatory]] hallucinations, typically regarded as manifestations of [[psychosis]].<ref>Kneisl C. and Trigoboff E.

Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes, and respond less well to medication.<ref name=CarsonNursing/> They commonly include flat expressions or [[blunted affect|little emotion]], [[alogia|poverty of speech]], [[anhedonia|inability to experience pleasure]], [[asociality|lack of desire to form relationships]], and [[avolition|lack of motivation]].

Assuming a hereditary basis, one question from [[evolutionary psychology]] is why genes that increase the likelihood of psychosis evolved, assuming the condition would have been [[maladaptive]] from an evolutionary point of view.

Particular attention has been paid to the function of dopamine in the [[mesolimbic pathway]] of the brain. This focus largely resulted from the accidental finding that [[phenothiazine]] drugs, which block dopamine function, could reduce psychotic symptoms. It is also supported by the fact that amphetamines, which trigger the release of dopamine, may exacerbate the psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia.<ref name="Laruelle_et_al_1996">{{cite journal |author=Laruelle M, Abi-Dargham A, van Dyck CH, et al. |title=Single photon emission computerized tomography imaging of amphetamine-induced dopamine release in drug-free schizophrenic subjects |journal=Proc.

The dopamine hypothesis is now thought to be simplistic, partly because newer antipsychotic medication ([[atypical antipsychotic]] medication) can be just as effective as older medication ([[typical antipsychotic]] medication), but also affects [[serotonin]] function and may have slightly less of a dopamine blocking effect.<ref name="JonesPilowsky2002">{{cite journal |author=Jones HM, Pilowsky LS |year=2002 |title=Dopamine and antipsychotic drug action revisited |journal=[[British Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=181 |pages=271–275 |pmid=12356650 |doi=10.1192/bjp.181.4.271}}</ref>

==Diagnosis==
{{Main|Diagnosis of schizophrenia}}
[[File:John Forbes Nash, Jr. by Peter Badge.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Forbes Nash|John Nash]], an American [[mathematician]] and joint winner of the 1994 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize for Economics]], who had schizophrenia. His life was the subject of the 2001 [[Academy Award]]-winning film ''[[A Beautiful Mind (film)|A Beautiful Mind]]''.]]

Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s fifth edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM 5), or the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[ICD|International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD-10). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a clinical assessment by a [[mental health professional]]. Symptoms associated with schizophrenia occur along a continuum in the population and must reach a certain severity before a diagnosis is made.<ref name=BMJ07/> As of 2013 there is no objective test.<ref name=DSM5pg101>{{cite book| author= American Psychiatric Association |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |publisher= American Psychiatric Publishing |location= Arlington |isbn= 978-0890425558 |pages= 101–05 |edition=5th}}</ref>

===Criteria===
In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association released the fifth edition of the DSM ([[DSM-5]]). To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, two diagnostic criteria have to be met over much of the time of a period of at least one month, with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months. The person had to be suffering from delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be negative symptoms or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour.<ref name="DSM5pgxx">{{cite book| author= American Psychiatric Association |title= Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |publisher= American Psychiatric Publishing |location= Arlington |isbn= 978-0890425558 |pages=  |edition=5th}}</ref> The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.
* Subtype classifications&nbsp;– such as catatonic and [[paranoid schizophrenia]] &nbsp;– are removed. These were retained in previous revisions largely for reasons of tradition, but had subsequently proved to be of little worth.<ref name=tandon/>
* [[Catatonia]] is no longer so strongly associated with schizophrenia.<ref name=cataonia-dsm>As referenced from PMID 23800613, {{cite journal |author=Heckers S, Tandon R, Bustillo J |title=Catatonia in the DSM--shall we move or not? |journal=Schizophr Bull |volume=36 |issue=2 |pages=205–7 |date=March 2010  |pmid=19933711 |pmc=2833126 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbp136 |type=Editorial}}</ref>
* In describing a person's schizophrenia, it is recommended that a better distinction be made between the current state of the condition and its historical progress, to achieve a clearer overall characterization.<ref name=tandon/>
* Special treatment of [[Schneider's first-rank symptoms]] is no longer recommended.<ref name=tandon/>

The ICD-10 criteria are typically used in European countries, while the DSM criteria are used in the United States and to varying degrees around the world, and are prevailing in research studies. The ICD-10 criteria put more emphasis on Schneiderian first-rank symptoms. In practice, agreement between the two systems is high.<ref name="Jakobsen_et_al_2005">{{cite journal |author=Jakobsen KD, Frederiksen JN, Hansen T, et al. |year=2005 |title=Reliability of clinical ICD-10 schizophrenia diagnoses |journal=Nordic Journal of Psychiatry |volume=59 | issue=3 |pages=209–12 |pmid=16195122 | doi = 10.1080/08039480510027698}}</ref>

If signs of disturbance are present for more than a month but less than six months, the diagnosis of [[schizophreniform disorder]] is applied. Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as [[brief psychotic disorder]], and various conditions may be classed as [[psychotic disorder not otherwise specified]], while [[schizoaffective disorder]] is diagnosed if symptoms of [[mood disorder]] are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. If the psychotic symptoms are the direct physiological result of a general medical condition or a substance, then the diagnosis is one of a psychosis secondary to that condition.<ref name="DSM5pgxx"/><!-- cites oprevious three sentences --> Schizophrenia is not diagnosed if symptoms of [[pervasive developmental disorder]] are present unless prominent delusions or hallucinations are also present.<ref name="DSM5pgxx"/><!-- will be different page to preceding ref -->

===Subtypes===
The DSM-5 work group proposed dropping the five sub-classifications of schizophrenia included in DSM-IV-TR:<ref>[[American Psychiatric Association]] DSM-5 Work Groups (2010) [http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/SchizophreniaandOtherPsychoticDisorders.aspx Proposed Revisions – Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders]. Retrieved 17 February 2010.</ref><ref name=WHOICD/>
* [[Paranoid schizophrenia|Paranoid type]]: Delusions or auditory hallucinations are present, but thought disorder, disorganized behavior, or affective flattening are not. Delusions are persecutory and/or grandiose, but in addition to these, other themes such as jealousy, religiosity, or [[somatization]] may also be present. (DSM code 295.3/ICD code F20.0)
* [[Disorganized schizophrenia|Disorganized type]]: Named ''hebephrenic schizophrenia'' in the ICD. Where thought disorder and flat affect are present together. (DSM code 295.1/ICD code F20.1)
* [[Catatonia|Catatonic type]]: The subject may be almost immobile or exhibit agitated, purposeless movement. Symptoms can include catatonic stupor and [[waxy flexibility]]. (DSM code 295.2/ICD code F20.2)
* Undifferentiated type: Psychotic symptoms are present but the criteria for paranoid, disorganized, or catatonic types have not been met. (DSM code 295.9/ICD code F20.3)
* Residual type: Where positive symptoms are present at a low intensity only. (DSM code 295.6/ICD code F20.5)

The ICD-10 defines two additional subtypes:<ref name=WHOICD>{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/GRNBOOK.pdf |title=The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders |format= PDF |publisher=World Health Organization |page=26}}</ref>
* Post-schizophrenic depression: A depressive episode arising in the aftermath of a schizophrenic illness where some low-level schizophrenic symptoms may still be present. (ICD code F20.4)
* [[Simple-type schizophrenia|Simple schizophrenia]]: Insidious and progressive development of prominent negative symptoms with no history of psychotic episodes. (ICD code F20.6)
[[Sluggish schizophrenia]] is in the Russian version of the ICD-10. "Sluggish schizophrenia" is in the category of "schizotypal" disorder in section F21 of chapter V.<ref>{{vcite web|title=МКБ-10: Классификация психических и поведенческих расстройств.

A more general medical and neurological examination may be needed to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as [[Metabolic disorder|metabolic disturbance]], [[systemic infection]], [[syphilis]], [[HIV]] infection, [[epilepsy]], and brain lesions.  [[Stroke]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[hyperthyroidism]], [[hypothyroidism]] and [[dementia]]s such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Huntington's disease]], [[frontotemporal dementia]] and [[Lewy Body dementia]] may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bradley's neurology in clinical practice|year=2012|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=1-4377-0434-4|author=Murray ED, Buttner N, Price BH|volume=1|edition=6th|pages=92–111|editor=Bradley WG, Daroff RB, Fenichel GM, Jankovic J|chapter=Depression and Psychosis in Neurological Practice}}</ref> It may be necessary to rule out a [[delirium]], which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating [[level of consciousness]], and indicates an underlying medical illness.

==History==
{{Main|History of schizophrenia}}
In the early 20th century, the psychiatrist [[Kurt Schneider]] listed the forms of psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. These are called ''first-rank symptoms'' or [[Kurt Schneider#First-rank symptoms in schizophrenia|Schneider's first-rank symptoms]]. They include delusions of being controlled by an external force; the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind; the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast to other people; and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one's thoughts or actions or that have a conversation with other hallucinated voices.<ref name="SchneiderClinicalPsychopathology">{{cite book|last1=Schneider |first1=K |authorlink1=Kurt Schneider |title=Clinical Psychopathology |url=http://books.google.com/?id=ofzOAAAAMAAJ |edition=5 |year=1959 |publisher=Grune & Stratton |location=New York }}</ref> Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria, the [[Sensitivity and specificity|specificity]] of first-rank symptoms has been questioned. A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-rank symptoms should be de-emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems.<ref name="pmid17562695">{{cite journal |author=Nordgaard J, Arnfred SM, Handest P, Parnas J |title=The diagnostic status of first-rank symptoms |journal=Schizophrenia Bulletin |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=137–54 |date=January 2008  |pmid=17562695 |pmc=2632385 |doi=10.1093/schbul/sbm044}}</ref>

The word ''schizophrenia''—which translates roughly as "splitting of the mind" and comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] roots ''schizein'' (σχίζειν, "to split") and ''phrēn'', ''phren-'' (φρήν, φρεν-, "mind")<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kuhn R |title=Eugen Bleuler's concepts of psychopathology |journal=History of Psychiatry|volume=15 |issue=3 |year=2004 |pages=361–6 |doi=10.1177/0957154X04044603 |pmid=15386868 |others=tr. Cahn CH}}</ref>—was coined by [[Eugen Bleuler]] in 1908 and was intended to describe the separation of function between [[personality psychology|personality]], [[thought|thinking]], [[memory]], and [[perception]]. American and British interpretations of Beuler led to the claim that he described its main symptoms as 4 ''A'''s: flattened ''Affect'', ''Autism'', impaired ''Association'' of ideas and ''Ambivalence''.<ref name="fn_78">{{cite journal |author=Stotz-Ingenlath G |title=Epistemological aspects of Eugen Bleuler's conception of schizophrenia in 1911 |journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=153–9 |year=2000 |pmid=11079343|url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=1386-7423&volume=3&page=153|format=PDF |doi=10.1023/A:1009919309015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=McNally K|title=Eugen Bleuler's "Four A's"|journal=History of Psychology|year=2009|volume=12|pages=43–59|doi=10.1037/a0015934|pmid=19831234|issue=2}}</ref>  Bleuler realized that the illness was not a dementia, as some of his patients improved rather than deteriorated, and thus proposed the term schizophrenia instead.

In the early 1970s, the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia were the subject of a number of controversies which eventually led to the [[operational definition|operational criteria]] used today. It became clear after the 1971 US-UK Diagnostic Study that schizophrenia was diagnosed to a far greater extent in America than in Europe.<ref name="Wing1971">{{cite journal |author=Wing JK |title=International comparisons in the study of the functional psychoses |journal=British Medical Bulletin |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=77–81 |date=January 1971  |pmid=4926366}}</ref> This was partly due to looser diagnostic criteria in the US, which used the [[DSM-II]] manual, contrasting with Europe and its [[ICD-9]]. [[David Rosenhan|David Rosenhan's]] 1972 study, published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' under the title "[[Rosenhan experiment|On being sane in insane places]]", concluded that the diagnosis of schizophrenia in the US was often subjective and unreliable.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rosenhan D |year=1973 |title=On being sane in insane places |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=179 |pages=250–8 |pmid=4683124| doi=10.1126/science.179.4070.250 |issue=4070}}</ref> These were some of the factors leading to the revision not only of the diagnosis of schizophrenia, but the revision of the whole DSM manual, resulting in the publication of the [[DSM-III]] in 1980.<ref name="Wilson1993">{{cite journal |author=Wilson M |title=DSM-III and the transformation of American psychiatry: a history |journal=[[American Journal of Psychiatry]] |volume=150 |issue=3 |pages=399–410 |date=March 1993  |pmid=8434655 }}</ref>
The term schizophrenia is commonly misunderstood to mean that affected persons have a "split personality". Although some people diagnosed with schizophrenia may hear voices and may experience the voices as distinct personalities, schizophrenia does not involve a person changing among distinct multiple personalities. The confusion arises in part due to the literal interpretation of Bleuler's term schizophrenia (Bleuler originally associated Schizophrenia with dissociation and included split personality in his category of Schizophrenia<ref>Stotz-Ingenlath G: Epistemological aspects of Eugen Bleuler’s conception of schizophrenia in 1911.
